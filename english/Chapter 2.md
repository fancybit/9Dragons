The 25th year of Wanli's reign in the Great Ming Dynasty, late spring.

The morning light in the side hall of Tranquility Palace was always softer and more gradual than elsewhere. Perhaps it was due to the shelter of the palace wall at the corner of the inner court's western path, or the lingering embrace of the few osmanthus trees in the courtyard. When the sun climbed over the palace wall, it was never as urgent as in other places. Located in the western part of the inner court, Tranquility Palace was specially arranged for Zhu Changlan by the Empress. Though not as spacious as the Eastern Palace, it was exquisitely laid out: behind the main hall were two side halls, east and west. The east side hall was Zhu Changlan's sleeping quarters, while the west side hall served as his study and alchemy room. The courtyard was small, but it was planted with several century-old osmanthus trees, planted by the Empress herself. Now they stood tall with lush canopies, their newly sprouted branches carrying a tender yellow hue, dotted with several small new leaves, exuding vitality. To the east of the courtyard was an old well with clear and sweet water, which Zhu Changlan often used to brew osmanthus wine. To the west were several magnolia trees, which bloomed like brocade in spring, their fragrance filling the air. Warmth, carrying the delicate fragrance of grass and trees, followed the wind's path, quietly entering the window lattice of the eastern side room, falling on the windowsill covered with plain silk brocade, making the small asparagus fern on the windowsill appear even greener. Swallows under the eaves returned with spring mud, landing on the carved corridor pillars, their chirping clear and melodious, like a string of broken jade falling into the silent courtyard—first a few scattered calls, gradually gathering into a chorus, finally waking the person sleeping on the couch from a light dream. In the corner of the courtyard, several sparrows hopped around pecking at the leftover grain from yesterday, occasionally letting out soft chirps, interweaving with the swallows' songs, forming the unique quiet melody of Tranquility Palace's early morning.

Zhu Changlan rolled over, and the brocade quilt slipped half off his shoulder, revealing the moon-white inner garment underneath. The collar of the inner garment was embroidered with a circle of extremely light silver cloud patterns, the stitches so fine they were almost invisible, the thread running smoothly and naturally—they were sewn by the top embroideresses from the Eastern Palace's embroidery workshop. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo had always known he disliked ostentation, even having the patterns on his intimate clothing specially ordered to be so restrained, neither losing the dignity of a prince nor appearing extravagant. His fingertips curled unconsciously, his nails round and full, showing a healthy pink color, then slowly unfolded, his finger pads rubbing against the plain mattress beneath him, which felt delicate and soft, carrying the residual warmth of the sun. This mattress was woven from the finest southern tribute cotton, the threads thin and uniform, the woven fabric dense yet not heavy, mixed with a small amount of silk inside, feeling as warm and soft as clouds, exceptionally comfortable against the skin. Last winter, the side hall of Tranquility Palace was exceptionally cold. Even though the window cracks were sealed with cotton paper, cold wind still seeped in. At night when sleeping, even wrapped in thick quilts, he always felt the cold seeping into his bones. When the Crown Prince learned of this, he immediately had three of the thickest tribute cotton mattresses from the Eastern Palace's treasury sent over overnight, personally instructing Little Salary: "My Ninth Brother has a cold constitution. You must ensure he sleeps on thick mattresses, and add a layer of felt underneath the bed to keep him from freezing."

When the Empress learned of this, she also specially sent over a silk quilt made from southern tribute silk, with exquisite cloud patterns embroidered on the quilt cover by the embroideresses from the Empress's palace. The stitches were fine, and its warmth retention was excellent. Though Zhu Changlan had always disliked extravagance, he couldn't bear to disappoint the Empress and Crown Prince's kind intentions, so he laid the silk quilt on the top layer. Every night, he could feel that faint warmth, as if the Empress and Crown Prince were right by his side. He turned to his side, his gaze falling on the low cabinet inside the bed, where there was a small brocade box containing not only the note the Crown Prince had written to him last year, but also a sachet sewn by the Empress herself, filled with soothing herbs, which the Empress had specially made for him after learning he had trouble sleeping.

"My Lord, are you awake?"

Little Salary's voice was as light as a wisp of smoke, coming through the curtain embroidered with intertwining lotus patterns, carrying a cautious inquiry. He had been with Zhu Changlan since childhood, knowing his lord's habits best. He knew Zhu Changlan was a light sleeper, most averse to early morning noise, even deliberately lightening his footsteps so that the soles of his boots barely made a sound on the ground. "The Crown Prince sent breakfast early in the morning, saying it was freshly baked crab meat soup dumplings, and your favorite almond pudding, kept warm in the food box. The Prince specially ordered that we serve it only after you wake up, to ensure you can eat it hot."

As he spoke, Little Salary gently lifted a corner of the curtain, revealing a simple and honest face, his eyes full of concern. When he saw Zhu Changlan was awake, a relaxed smile appeared on his face. Behind him was a young palace maid, holding a basin of warm water for Zhu Changlan to wash up, the water temperature carefully adjusted to be neither cold nor hot, just right.

Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, his eyes still carrying a hint of sleepiness, like a thin layer of mist. He blinked, his long eyelashes fluttering gently, as light as butterfly wings. After a moment, the sleepiness in his eyes gradually dissipated. His gaze fell on the intertwining lotus patterns embroidered on the canopy, which were complex and exquisite, every stitch showing craftsmanship—this canopy was also a gift from the Crown Prince. On the plain brocade, there were darkly embroidered several swimming fish, each in different poses, some wagging their tails, some blowing bubbles, lifelike. That was in the year he first entered the palace, when he followed the Crown Prince to feed fish by the lake in the imperial garden. He had casually mentioned that he "liked the free fish in the water," and to his surprise, the Crown Prince had remembered. Within a few days, he sent this canopy, smiling and saying: "Let these swimming fish accompany you, so you can sleep as freely as they do."

His nose twitched slightly, as if already smelling the unique fragrance of crab meat soup dumplings, which were the signature dim sum from the Eastern Palace's small kitchen, and one of the few meat dim sums he could accept. The head chef of the Eastern Palace's small kitchen was specially invited by the Crown Prince from the south, best at making such delicate dim sum. Those crab meat soup dumplings had skins as thin as cicada wings, almost transparent enough to see the filling inside. When you bit into them, the soup overflowed, fresh but not greasy, each bite unforgettable. He slowly sat up, and Little Salary quickly stepped forward, draping a thin blanket over his shoulders, whispering: "My Lord has just woken up, be careful not to catch a cold."

"Bring it in."

His tone still carried the softness of just waking up, the end of his voice rising slightly, like the soft hum of a cat just finishing its stretch, with a hint of unknowing charm.

Little Salary responded and withdrew, soon returning with two young eunuchs from the Eastern Palace, their steps all deliberately light. The leading eunuch was named Little Happiness, the most capable attendant of the Crown Prince, having followed him for more than ten years. He was capable and thoughtful, always with a gentle smile on his face, making people feel particularly approachable. His bowing gesture was standard yet not stiff, his waist bent just right, his voice also controlled just right—respectful yet gentle: "Greetings to the Ninth Prince. The Crown Prince said he knew Your Highness is fond of sleeping in, so he specially had the kitchen keep the breakfast warm. He said you should have it while it's hot to avoid hurting your stomach."

Behind him, a young eunuch carried a vermilion lacquer food box with gold patterns, the handle wrapped in green satin embroidered with small cloud patterns, appearing particularly elegant. The food box was made with the finest vermilion lacquer, the surface as smooth as a mirror, able to clearly reflect people's shadows. The box body was painted with gold thread, outlining intertwining lotus patterns, the gold thread and vermilion lacquer complementing each other, showing nobility without ostentation. Little Happiness signaled the eunuch behind him to place the food box on the square table by the window, his movements gentle, afraid of making any noise to disturb Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan sat up, allowing Little Salary to tie the jade belt of his brocade robe while casually asking, with a hint of unintentional concern in his tone: "Did the Crown Prince have morning court today?"

The stone-blue brocade robe he was wearing was also a gift from the Crown Prince last year, made from the finest southern tribute brocade, its texture as soft as spring water, smooth to the touch. Its color was calm yet not dull, glowing faintly in the morning light. The cuffs and collar of the brocade robe were embroidered with extremely light dark patterns, simple cloud patterns, almost imperceptible unless you looked closely—perfect for his unostentatious nature. As the Crown Prince, the future emperor, he had to handle numerous affairs every day, and morning court was indispensable. He often had to get up before dawn, so busy he didn't even have time to eat a proper breakfast. Every time he thought of this, he couldn't help but feel a little distressed, always wanting to do something for the Crown Prince, but knowing he couldn't be of much help, he could only silently keep him in mind.

"Returning to Your Highness, the Crown Prince went to morning court early."

Little Happiness replied with a smile, skillfully opening the food box. "Before he left, he specially instructed this servant to tell you that after you finish breakfast, if you have time, you should come to the Eastern Palace. He said he found something good to show you, and he's sure you'll like it."

Zhu Changlan raised his eyebrows, a trace of genuine curiosity flashing in his eyes, like a child hearing something interesting. The Crown Prince had always known his preferences, never sending those flashy gold and silver treasures or exotic curios. Every time he said "something good," it always precisely hit his heart. He carefully recalled that the Crown Prince had given him many things, each carrying the Crown Prince's intentions: either a piece of warm yellow poplar wood suitable for making a brush rest, with clear grain and delicate texture, which he had been using and reluctant to replace; or a rare poetry collection with yellowed pages but well-preserved, with previous owners' annotations, which he cherished; or a delicately crafted round fan with a comfortable fan bone, made of the finest sandalwood, with ink bamboo painted by the Crown Prince himself, showing unyielding character. Last time, the Crown Prince gave him a piece of black jade from Kunlun Mountain, which was completely black, cool to the touch, carrying a faint fragrance that could calm the mind. At that time, he was encountering a bottleneck in his cultivation, always unable to sleep well at night. After receiving this black jade, he kept it by his pillow and indeed slept much more peacefully. Thinking of this, he became even more curious, wondering what surprise the Crown Prince had prepared for him this time.

After washing up, he walked to the table and sat down. Little Happiness had already skillfully arranged everything from the food box, his movements gentle, afraid of breaking the food inside. The first layer was a bamboo steamer filled with crab meat soup dumplings, still emitting a faint white steam, the fragrance wafting through the air, making people's mouths water. The dumplings were round and plump, like small white jade balls, with skins as thin as paper, clearly showing the yellow crab paste and pink shrimp meat inside. The second layer was a small bowl of almond pudding, served in an exquisite white porcelain bowl, its color milky white, as delicate as congealed fat, topped with a few crushed almonds and a little honey. The sweet fragrance of honey intertwined with the clear fragrance of almonds, sweet and enticing. The third layer was a plate of delicate crystal shrimp dumplings, crystal clear, like transparent little lanterns, vaguely showing the pink shrimp meat inside. The shrimp meat was plump and firm, accompanied by a small dish of dipping sauce made from fragrant vinegar and ginger. The sour fragrance of the vinegar just cut through the greasiness, while the ginger removed the coldness of the shrimp. In addition, the food box also contained a small plate of refreshing cold cucumber, the cucumber crisp and tasty, drizzled with a little sesame oil and soy sauce, used to appetize and cut through the greasiness. Clearly, the Crown Prince had specially instructed this, knowing that he would feel greasy after eating too much meat.

"Your Highness, please try them quickly. These soup dumplings were just made at the fifth hour this morning. The crab paste was from large crabs freshly transported from Taihu Lake yesterday. Each crab was carefully selected for its plump roe and meat, yielding a full half-bowl of crab paste."

Little Happiness said eagerly, with a hint of pride in his tone, as if he had made the dumplings himself. "The Crown Prince specially instructed the kitchen to use less ginger in the crab paste, to avoid overshadowing the freshness of the crab meat, so you won't find it too strong. The Prince also said that you have a weak stomach, so even though the soup dumplings are delicious, you shouldn't eat too many. He suggested you eat two first to fill your stomach, then try the almond pudding, which is gentle and nourishing for the stomach."

As Little Happiness spoke, he picked up a pair of clean chopsticks, handing them to Zhu Changlan with eyes full of respect. Having followed the Crown Prince for many years, he knew the Crown Prince's high regard for this Ninth Prince, and also knew the weight this Ninth Prince held in the Crown Prince's heart, so he naturally didn't dare to neglect him in the slightest.

Zhu Changlan took the chopsticks, which were made of ivory, warm and smooth to the touch, with just the right weight in his hand, neither too heavy nor too light, feeling excellent—they were also a gift from the Crown Prince. He gently picked up a soup dumpling, the skin extremely thin, almost breaking at the touch. He carefully held it, afraid of breaking the skin and wasting the soup inside. He took a small bite, and the scalding soup instantly burst on his tongue. The delicious crab meat mixed with the sweet broth had a rich texture but wasn't greasy at all. The fresh fragrance of the crab meat filled his mouth, lingering for a long time. The ginger flavor was so faint it was almost imperceptible, just enough to counteract the coldness of the crab without overshadowing the crab meat's natural freshness. The seasoning was just right. He narrowed his eyes, showing a satisfied expression, like a cat that had eaten something delicious, his long eyelashes fluttering gently, with a hint of contentment, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, his eyes full of smiles. "Delicious."

He couldn't help but say softly, his voice carrying sincere praise. He picked up another one, this time taking a bigger bite, and soup flowed down the corner of his mouth. Little Salary quickly handed over a clean brocade handkerchief, and Zhu Changlan took it, gently wiping the corner of his mouth, his face showing a hint of embarrassed red, like a child caught stealing.

"The Eastern Palace's craftsmanship is still authentic."

He said with a smile, his voice carrying sincere praise, then picked up another one, slowly savoring it. The dumpling skin was extremely thin but very resilient, wrapping the plump filling. With each bite, you could taste the sweetness of the crab meat and the fragrance of the dough, perfectly matched.

Little Salary poured him a cup of warm water by his side, whispering: "My Lord, eat slowly, don't burn yourself."

Zhu Changlan nodded, taking a sip of warm water, which slid down his throat, warm and comfortable, just relieving the scalding of the soup dumplings. He put down his chopsticks, picked up the jade spoon beside him, and scooped a spoonful of almond pudding into his mouth. The almond pudding had a texture as fine as clouds, melting in the mouth without the slightest graininess, sweet but not cloying, with a faint almond fragrance, just neutralizing the saltiness of the soup dumplings. This almond pudding was also one of his favorites. The Crown Prince knew he was afraid of bitterness, so every time he had the almonds ground extremely fine, and specially added more honey and milk to completely mask the bitterness of the almonds, making it exceptionally smooth and warm. He remembered once when he was ill in bed, with no appetite, unable to eat anything. When the Crown Prince learned of this, he personally stayed by his bedside, having people cook almond pudding bowl after bowl until he was willing to eat. Since then, this almond pudding had become the food he relied on most when he was sick. He ate slowly, savoring each bite, his face showing a relaxed smile, as if this simple breakfast was the most precious delicacy in the world. After eating two soup dumplings and half a bowl of almond pudding, he picked up a crystal shrimp dumpling, dipped it in some sauce, and the fresh fragrance of the shrimp dumpling merged with the sour fragrance of the sauce, creating a rich texture that was unforgettable. Little Happiness watched from the side, seeing him eat happily, a smile also appearing on his face.

After finishing breakfast, Zhu Changlan felt warm all over, and also remembered the "something good" the Crown Prince had mentioned, so he stood up and said: "Little Salary, prepare the carriage, I'm going to the Eastern Palace."

Little Salary quickly agreed, turning around and hurrying to prepare the carriage. Zhu Changlan returned to his room, walked to the desk, and took a round fan with a winged wood fan bone. This round fan was made by himself, the fan bone was the finest winged wood, with clear grain, flowing like water waves. After careful polishing by him, it felt smooth and delicate. The fan surface was a landscape painting he had painted himself with ink and wash, distant mountains like dark clouds, near water containing mist, with a few small thatched cottages in the mountains, a winding path in front of the cottages, and a lazy cat lying on a rock sunbathing, looking leisurely and carefree. The signature was "Xuan Yu" (Meta Jade), which was his style name, the brushstrokes elegant and casual, with a hint of freedom. The reason he painted such a picture was that he had always longed for such a leisurely and free life, away from the conflicts of the deep palace, away from the troubles of the world. He held the round fan in his hand, gently fanning it a few times, the breeze carrying a faint wood fragrance, making him feel particularly refreshed. Then, he walked to the wardrobe, taking out a small jar of osmanthus wine from the drawer—this was brewed by him a few days ago, using the golden osmanthus flowers collected last autumn. Last autumn, the osmanthus flowers in Tranquility Palace bloomed particularly luxuriantly, the golden petals covering the courtyard, their fragrance rich and intense. He personally collected the petals, carefully selected them, removed impurities, then dried them and soaked them in homemade rice wine, sealing them in a clay jar. It had been sealed for half a year, and the fragrance was getting richer. The Crown Prince also loved this drink, but with many rules in the Eastern Palace, it wasn't convenient to drink much. He thought of bringing it over, so the two of them could have a small drink in the side hall, which would be quite pleasant. He carefully tucked the osmanthus wine into his sleeve, afraid of spilling it.

Walking out of Tranquility Palace, the crabapple flowers on both sides of the palace path were in full bloom, their pink and white petals layered, like clouds piled on the branches. Some were already fully open, revealing their tender yellow stamens, while others were still buds, like small lanterns, extremely cute. A breeze blew, and petals fell like snow, creating a pink petal rain, covering the bluestone path like a pink carpet. Walking on it was soft, and you could still smell the faint floral fragrance. Zhu Changlan slowed down, looking at the dancing petals in the sky, his eyes full of gentle smiles. He had always liked these flowers and plants, finding them pure and beautiful, unlike human hearts which were so complex. As long as you took good care of them, they would repay you with their most beautiful appearance.

Many palace maids and eunuchs passed by on the palace path, and when they saw Zhu Changlan, they all stopped and bowed respectfully. Zhu Changlan smiled and nodded in response, his steps not stopping, continuing to walk forward. He could feel that the way these palace maids and eunuchs looked at him was much more respectful than before, all because of the Crown Prince. If it weren't for the Crown Prince's protection, he would have probably suffered a lot in this deep palace.

The carriage was already waiting outside the palace gate, its body a low-key dark brown, made of fine wood, carefully polished and lacquered, the surface as smooth as a mirror. The interior walls of the carriage were lined with soft brocade, the color of which was an elegant light blue, embroidered with small orchid patterns, fresh and elegant. On the seat was a soft pillow embroidered with a cat, specially made by Zhu Changlan. The pillow was filled with soft silk, making it exceptionally comfortable to lean against. He climbed into the carriage, leaning against the soft pillow, closing his eyes, taking a deep breath. The carriage was filled with a faint sandalwood fragrance, which he had specially placed there to calm his mind. The carriage slowly moved forward, the body slightly jolting, but not uncomfortable, instead like a gentle rocking, making him feel particularly relaxed. In his ears was the "creak" of the wheels rolling over the bluestone path, and the sound of birds chirping and petals falling outside the window, everything appearing exceptionally pleasant. He closed his eyes like this, feeling the carriage's jolting, unconsciously recalling the bits and pieces of his time with the Crown Prince, a gentle smile appearing on his face.

Before long, the carriage arrived at the Eastern Palace. At the gate of the Eastern Palace, Little Happiness had already been waiting. When he saw Zhu Changlan's carriage, he quickly stepped forward and bowed: "Ninth Prince, the Crown Prince has already returned from court and is waiting for you in the study."

Zhu Changlan got off the carriage, following Little Happiness into the Eastern Palace. The layout of the Eastern Palace was much more spacious than Tranquility Palace, but not as cold and distant as the imperial palace, everywhere permeated with warm human touch. This was all because Crown Prince Zhu Changluo had always had a gentle temperament and disliked those cumbersome formalities. The Eastern Palace's arrangement was mostly according to his preferences. Many red lanterns hung under the corridor, their color a bright red, embroidered with golden "fu" (good fortune) characters, appearing particularly festive. Green vines wrapped around the corridor pillars, their leaves a tender green, full of vitality, winding up along the pillars, decorating the corridor pillars especially elegantly. In the courtyard was a small lotus pond, the water clear to the bottom, clearly seeing the pebbles and swimming fish at the bottom. A few willow trees were planted by the pond, their branches slender, hanging down to the water's surface. When the wind blew, the willow branches swayed gently, and their reflections in the water also shook, especially elegant. On the stone table by the pond, there was a set of tea utensils, made of white porcelain, painted with faint lotus patterns, clearly a place where the Crown Prince usually rested and enjoyed the scenery. Many exotic flowers and rare plants were planted in the courtyard, peonies blooming gracefully and luxuriously, roses blooming with charming beauty, orchids blooming with elegant purity, and many other flowers whose names he didn't know, competing to bloom, beautiful beyond compare, the air filled with a strong floral fragrance.

"The Crown Prince knows you like wooden things, so he specially had the tables and chairs in the study replaced with red sandalwood. He said it has a hard texture and rich fragrance, which you will definitely like."

Little Happiness said with a smile as he walked, "Even the brush rest and paperweight in the study were made by the Prince according to your preferences, all simple but handy objects."

Zhu Changlan nodded, a warm feeling welling up in his heart, like a warm current, slowly flowing through his limbs. The Crown Prince was always like this, keeping his preferences in mind, even for trivial matters, he would take them to heart and do them carefully. He remembered when he first entered the palace after reincarnation, he was still young, only seven or eight years old, his birth mother had just passed away, his father paid no attention to him, placing him in the remote Tranquility Palace, almost forgetting his existence. The palace maids and eunuchs were all people who followed the wind, seeing he was not favored, they neglected him in every possible way, withholding his rations, not giving enough charcoal in winter, not giving cool fruits in summer, and even his clothes were only changed once in a long while, ragged and worn. Once, he saw other princes having exquisite toys, and he envied them very much, so he casually mentioned to the eunuch taking care of him that he wanted a wooden rattle. He mentioned it several times, but no one took it seriously, and that eunuch even laughed at him: "A prince who's not favored still wants toys."

Somehow, this matter reached the Crown Prince's ears. At that time, the Crown Prince was only in his teens. When he learned about it, he personally ran to Tranquility Palace to see him. When he saw him wearing ragged clothes, his little face red from the cold, he felt very distressed. After asking, he learned that the eunuch had withheld his charcoal. The Crown Prince was furious on the spot, immediately having that eunuch arrested and flogged with thirty strikes, beating him until his skin was torn and his flesh was mangled, and then driving him out of the palace, never to be employed again. Not only that, the Crown Prince also specially had someone notify the Imperial Household Department, severely reprimanding the relevant officials, and ordering that Tranquility Palace's rations be doubled from now on. Anyone who dared to neglect again would be severely punished. Since then, the palace maids and eunuchs no longer dared to neglect him at will, treating him with respect, not daring to be the least bit careless. He had always remembered this incident, never forgetting the Crown Prince's protection.

Entering the study, a faint scent of ink and sandalwood hit his face, making him feel calm. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was sitting at the desk reviewing memorials, wearing a bright yellow casual robe made of fine silk, with a soft texture and bright color, a jade belt around his waist inlaid with a fine white jade, warm and transparent. He had a handsome face, with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, a high nose, and thin lips, combining to make him particularly handsome. Between his eyebrows was a trace of composure and authority, cultivated from years of handling government affairs, but without losing his gentleness. Sunlight shone through the window lattice onto him, plating him with a layer of warm yellow light, making him appear particularly gentle and warm. He held a vermilion brush in his hand, the tip of the brush dipped in red cinnabar, annotating memorials, his expression focused, his eyebrows slightly furrowed, apparently encountering a tricky matter. Hearing footsteps, he looked up, and when he saw Zhu Changlan, a warm smile instantly appeared on his face, like a spring breeze blowing over a frozen lake, instantly melting the exhaustion and seriousness between his eyebrows, the tiredness in his eyes also dissipating a lot: "Ninth Brother, you're finally here, come sit. Did you have a tiring journey?"

He put down the vermilion brush in his hand, leaning slightly forward, his eyes full of concern.

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, bowing: "Elder Brother."

"No need for formalities."

Zhu Changluo waved his hand, pointing to the red sandalwood chair opposite the desk, "Sit down. The tea is just brewed, it's your favorite Lapsang Souchong."

Zhu Changlan sat down, picking up the tea cup on the table, taking a shallow sip. The tea temperature was just right, clear and mellow, exactly to his liking. "Elder Brother's tea is always brewed just right."

He said with a smile.

Zhu Changluo smiled, putting down the vermilion brush in his hand, rubbing his forehead, his fingers gently pressing his temples, apparently having been reviewing memorials all morning, feeling a bit tired. "I'm glad you like it."

His tone was gentle, with a hint of relaxation, "The affairs of the court are complicated, with endless memorials to handle and disputes to deal with every day. After a morning of busy work, my head is almost exploding. It's only when I see you that I can relax a bit, feeling my mind become clear."

He paused, his gaze falling on Zhu Changlan, with a hint of concern, carefully looking him over, as if to confirm he was well: "How is everything in Tranquility Palace recently? Has anyone neglected you? Are the rations delivered on time? Is there enough charcoal?"

The Crown Prince's series of questions made Zhu Changlan's heart warm, knowing that the Crown Prince had always been concerned about his daily life. As the Crown Prince, the Crown Prince had countless things to handle every day, but he still found time to care about his daily life. This kind of intention made him particularly moved.

"It's all good, everything is fine."

Zhu Changlan said with a smile, his tone sincere, "Little Salary takes good care of me, and the people in the palace don't dare to neglect me. The rations are delivered on time, and they're even more abundant than before. There's enough charcoal, and it's very warm when sleeping at night."

The Crown Prince had always worried that he was being wronged in Tranquility Palace, and would often have someone secretly take care of him, also specially instructing the Imperial Household Department to take good care of his daily life. Even if those palace maids and eunuchs were no matter how snobbish, they wouldn't dare to disobey the Crown Prince's orders, so they naturally wouldn't really make things difficult for him. Once, a new eunuch didn't know the depths, thinking he was not favored, deliberately delayed delivering breakfast. When the person sent by the Crown Prince found out, the Crown Prince directly ordered that eunuch to be given twenty strokes with a wooden rod and driven out of the palace. Since then, the people in the palace were even more respectful to him, not daring to be the least bit careless. He looked at the Crown Prince, adding: "Elder Brother, don't worry, I'm doing very well in Tranquility Palace, you don't need to worry about me."

"That's good."

Zhu Changluo nodded, a relieved expression appearing on his face, "If anyone dares to bully you, just tell me, and I won't let them off lightly."

His tone was gentle but carried an undeniable firmness, like a reliable mountain, making people feel at ease.

After chatting for a while, Zhu Changlan couldn't help but ask: "Elder Brother called me here, saying you have something good to show me?"

His eyes were full of anticipation, like a curious child.

Zhu Changluo smiled, his eyes with a hint of mystery, taking out an exquisite wooden box from the desk drawer. This wooden box was made of a whole piece of golden phoebe wood, without any extra decoration, polished smooth, emitting a faint luster. Only on the lid was carved a small cat paw print, small and delicate, extremely cute, obviously specially designed for Zhu Changlan. A thin circle of silver wire was inlaid around the edge of the wooden box, the silver wire outlining simple patterns, both exquisite and simple yet elegant. Zhu Changluo gently placed the wooden box on the table, pushing it in front of Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of anticipation: "Open it and see, see if you like it."

Zhu Changlan had always liked wooden utensils, and he especially favored golden phoebe wood. The Crown Prince specially chose golden phoebe wood to make this wooden box, hoping that Zhu Changlan would like it.

Zhu Changlan curiously picked up the wooden box, feeling it was warm and delicate to the touch. The unique fragrance of golden phoebe wood lingered at his nose, making him feel particularly comfortable, indicating it was good quality wood at a glance. He gently opened the wooden box, and with a "click" sound, the hinge of the box turned flexibly, without any sticking. Inside was lined with a layer of red velvet, soft and smooth, the color bright, setting off the contents inside particularly eye-catching. On the velvet lay a wooden dagger—the handle of the dagger was made of a whole piece of golden phoebe wood, carved with intertwining lotus patterns, the lines smooth, lifelike, exactly the same as the patterns on his pear wood recliner, obviously made by the same craftsman. The length of the handle was just right, fitting comfortably in the hand, conforming to the curve of the palm. The blade was cold and shining, obviously forged from fine iron, extremely sharp, yet with a hint of warmth, clearly carefully polished, with smooth edges, no burrs at all. There were also simple cloud patterns carved on the blade, simple yet elegant, adding a touch of charm to this dagger.

"This is......"

Zhu Changlan picked up the dagger, carefully examining it, his eyes full of surprise. He had always liked wooden utensils, and the handle material and craftsmanship of this dagger were both excellent, obviously costing a lot of thought to make.

"I had it specially made for you."

Zhu Changluo said with a smile, his tone with a hint of pride, like a child being praised, "I know you usually like to practice some martial arts, but you never had a handy weapon. Those metal weapons are either too heavy or too ostentatious, not suitable for you. The handle of this dagger is made of golden phoebe wood, which is warm and smooth, something you like. The blade is forged from western region fine iron, hammered a thousand times, repeatedly polished, able to cut through iron like mud, extremely sharp. It can be used for self-defense or for practicing martial arts."

He paused, continuing: "I specially had the blade polished to be rounder, to prevent you from accidentally cutting yourself. The intertwining lotus patterns on the handle were carved by the craftsman according to your recliner, you should like them. To make this dagger, I looked for several craftsmen, compared several kinds of wood and steel, and finally confirmed it, spending more than three months from start to finish."

When Zhu Changluo talked about the process of making the dagger, his eyes were full of seriousness, obviously having spent a lot of thought.

Zhu Changlan held the dagger, his fingertips rubbing the wooden handle, feeling the delicate texture and warm touch on it, his heart warm, like a warm current flowing through. He could imagine that the Crown Prince must have spent a lot of thought on this dagger—when choosing materials, he would have picked the warmest and most suitable golden phoebe wood for the handle among many kinds of wood; when choosing steel, he would have personally compared the hardness and sharpness of various steels, selecting the most suitable western region fine iron; when designing, he would have considered his preferences and usage habits, designing the length and patterns of the handle just right; when forging, he would have supervised the craftsman to repeatedly polish, ensuring the blade was sharp but not ostentatious, avoiding him accidentally cutting himself. Every link condensed the Crown Prince's intentions, every detail reflected the Crown Prince's care. He gently waved the dagger, his movements light, and the dagger flashed a cold light in the sunlight, but it wasn't dazzling. He could feel that this dagger had a moderate weight, fitting particularly well in his hand, as if it was tailor-made for him.

"Thank you, Elder Brother."

Zhu Changlan looked up, looking at Zhu Changluo, sincerely saying. In this deep palace, only the Crown Prince treated him with such sincerity, putting his preferences and safety first.

Zhu Changluo smiled, waving his hand: "We are brothers, no need to thank me. As long as you like it."

He paused, then added: "This dagger has another special feature, look at the end of the handle."

Hearing this, Zhu Changlan looked at the end of the handle, and saw there was a small groove there, in which was inlaid a small cat's eye stone, crystal clear, with a vertical light pattern that rotated with the observation angle, like a cat's eye staring at him.

"This cat's eye stone is a rare treasure I had specially found from the western region, with a warm texture and a lively color."

Zhu Changluo explained, his eyes with a hint of gentleness, "I had it polished very round, not only good-looking, but also able to balance the dagger, making it more comfortable for you to wield. Moreover, this cat's eye stone has the effect of nourishing the mind. If you carry it with you every day, it can not only calm your mind but also be beneficial to your cultivation."

He paused, his voice lowering a bit, with a hint of caution: "I know you have your own cultivation path, although you've never talked about it in detail, I can feel that you're not an ordinary person. Last time, you casually mentioned after drinking that you 'occasionally meditate and regulate your breathing,' and I remembered it, specially having someone find this cat's eye stone, hoping it can help you."

When Zhu Changluo said this, his eyes were full of sincerity, without the slightest trace of curiosity or prying, only pure care.

Zhu Changlan's heart moved. He had never told anyone about his cultivation, only casually mentioning to the Crown Prince once after drinking that he "occasionally meditated and regulated his breathing." Unexpectedly, the Crown Prince had remembered it and specially found this warm jade that could nourish the mind for him. He looked at Zhu Changluo, his eyes with a hint of doubt and gratitude.

Zhu Changluo seemed to see through his thoughts, smiling and saying: "I know you're not an ordinary person, and you have many secrets."

His tone was calm, without the slightest surprise or prying, as if this was the most normal thing in the world, "But don't worry, I won't ask. Everyone has their own secrets, and I respect you."

His gaze was gentle and firm, like the warm spring sun, warm but not burning, "I only hope you can be safe and not be bullied. In this deep palace, people's hearts are unpredictable, full of open and hidden struggles. You have too gentle a temperament, don't know how to guard against others, and are easily taken advantage of. With this dagger by your side, you can have something to defend yourself with when you encounter danger, and I can feel more at ease."

He paused, continuing: "No matter what your identity is, no matter what secrets you have, you are my Ninth Brother, and I will always protect you. In front of me, you don't need to be on guard, you can be yourself completely."

The Crown Prince's words were like a warm current, instantly flowing through Zhu Changlan's entire body, making him feel particularly warm and at ease.

Looking at the Crown Prince's sincere eyes, Zhu Changlan's heart was filled with emotion, his eyes slightly moist, almost tears falling. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, experiencing the cruel fights in the demon world, where brothers turned against each other and friends betrayed each other for cultivation resources, everywhere full of intrigue. He had also experienced the joys and sorrows of the human world, witnessing too many separations, the treacherous nature of human hearts, which he had long seen through. He had seen too many people who would do anything for power, status, and interests, even harming those around them. But he had never met someone like the Crown Prince, who didn't ask about his past, didn't ask about his secrets, didn't want anything in return, only wanted to protect him, putting his safety first. In the demon world, he was the high and mighty Immortal Meta Jade, with powerful strength, but always lonely, without anyone he could trust. In the human world, he was the unfavored Ninth Prince, with a low status, but because of the Crown Prince's protection, he felt a warmth and care he had never felt before. The Crown Prince's intention was pure and sincere, making him cherish it very much, and making him feel that the nearly thousand years of waiting and loneliness were all worth it. He tightly held the dagger in his hand, and the warm touch from the handle made his heart particularly calm.

"Elder Brother, I......"

Zhu Changlan opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but didn't know what to say. Thousands of words finally turned into one sentence, "You should also take care of yourself."

Zhu Changluo smiled, patting his shoulder, his palm warm and powerful, with a reassuring strength: "I will."

He picked up the memorial on the table, his tone becoming serious, his eyebrows also slightly furrowed, obviously thinking of the disputes in the court: "But recently, the court is not peaceful. Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince are acting frequently, they won't be peaceful. Concubine Zheng has always wanted the Third Prince to inherit the throne, and has long been dissatisfied with me. Over the years, they have given me a lot of trouble secretly. The last imperial examination fraud case, and the previous grain transport corruption case, all have their shadows behind them."

He paused, his tone with a hint of heaviness: "In Tranquility Palace, you must be more careful in everything, don't easily get involved in disputes, try to appear in public as little as possible. The most important thing is to protect yourself. If you encounter anything, send someone to notify me immediately, don't bear it alone."

The Crown Prince knew the methods of Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince very well, they were ruthless, stopping at nothing. He was worried that they would turn their attention to Zhu Changlan, harming him.

Hearing this, Zhu Changlan's expression also became serious, the smile on his face gradually disappearing. What the Crown Prince said was true, and he had long heard of Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince's ambitions. Concubine Zheng was the mother of the Third Prince, from a famous and powerful family, with many supporters in the court. The Third Prince, Zhu Changxun, had an arrogant and domineering temperament, was narrow-minded, and extremely jealous, always jealous of the Crown Prince's position as the heir, opposing him everywhere. And as the only younger brother close to the Crown Prince, he naturally became a thorn in Concubine Zheng's side. Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince had long wanted to get rid of him. A few days ago, he had also heard that people from Concubine Zheng's palace were inquiring about his whereabouts and preferences, which was definitely not a good sign, and they were probably planning some conspiracy. Although he had practiced for many years and had certain strength, in this deep palace, there were rules and eyes everywhere. If he really had a conflict with Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince, he would probably be in a dilemma, and would also implicate the Crown Prince. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel worried.

"I know, Elder Brother." Zhu Changlan said, "I will try to avoid them, not causing you trouble."

"Silly Brother,"

Zhu Changluo shook his head, his eyes with a hint of helplessness and affection, "You are not my trouble, you are my only brother, and it's natural for me to protect you."

He paused, his tone becoming exceptionally firm, "If they really attack you, you don't have to endure it, just fight back. With me here, no one can hurt you."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his heart warm, like being wrapped in sunlight. The Crown Prince always kept his promises, never saying anything he couldn't do. Back then, when he first entered the palace, because he was not favored, no one in the palace took him seriously. There was a eunuch in charge of managing the charcoal in Tranquility Palace who thought he was young and easy to bully, and was not favored, so he deliberately withheld his charcoal rations. In winter, the side hall of Tranquility Palace was exceptionally cold, and he often shivered from the cold, even sleeping at night wrapped in thick quilts, still feeling the cold piercing his bones. Once, when the Crown Prince came to see him, he saw him with a red face from the cold and cold hands and feet, and felt very distressed. Upon inquiry, he learned that it was that eunuch who had withheld the charcoal. The Crown Prince was furious on the spot, immediately having that eunuch arrested and flogged with thirty strokes, beating him until his skin was torn and his flesh was mangled, and then driving him out of the palace, never to be employed again. Not only that, the Crown Prince also specially had someone notify the Imperial Household Department, severely reprimanding the relevant officials, and ordering that Tranquility Palace's rations be doubled from now on. Anyone who dared to neglect again would be severely punished. Since then, no one in the palace dared to neglect him anymore, treating him with respect, not daring to be the least bit careless. This incident, he had always remembered in his heart, never forgetting the Crown Prince's protection.

The two chatted for a while longer, the topic gradually shifting from court disputes to poetry and literature, and the atmosphere became much more relaxed. The Crown Prince knew Zhu Changlan liked poetry, and would often specially collect some famous poets' works to discuss with him. The Crown Prince picked up a poetry collection on the table, opened one page, and said with a smile: "Ninth Brother, look at this poem 'Bring in the Wine' by Li Bai, 'Heaven gave me talent, it will be put to use; a thousand gold coins spent, more will come again.' The momentum is magnificent, full of lofty aspirations, reading it makes people's blood boil."

Zhu Changlan leaned over to look, nodding: "It's indeed well written. Li Bai's poems have always been bold and free, full of romanticism, making people admire him."

Zhu Changlan also shared his recent new work, a poem about the mountains and rivers of Kunlun, which read: "Kunlun snow reflects the sky's cold, sea of clouds connects to distant mountains. Solitary crane flies endlessly through the clouds, heart follows the clear wind into the clouds."

Every word and sentence revealed his yearning for freedom and his attachment to the mountains and rivers of Kunlun. The Crown Prince listened with interest, nodding from time to time in praise. After Zhu Changlan finished reading, he thought for a moment, putting forward some pertinent suggestions: "The line 'Kunlun snow reflects the sky's cold' is excellent, with an open artistic conception, depicting the magnificent scenery of Kunlun snow mountains. But the word 'cold' is a bit bleak, it's better to change it to 'leisure,' which not only fits the quiet and distant snow scenery, but also matches your leisurely and indifferent temperament, and is more in line with the latter 'heart follows the clear wind into the clouds.'"

Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up, quickly nodding: "Elder Brother is right, 'Kunlun snow reflects the sky's leisure' is indeed more to my liking."

He didn't expect that the Crown Prince not only understood government affairs, but also had such unique insights into poetry.

As they chatted, Zhu Changlan remembered the osmanthus wine he had tucked in his sleeve, so he took it out, saying with a smile: "Elder Brother, this is the osmanthus wine I brewed a few days ago, using the golden osmanthus from last autumn, sealed for half a year. Taste it."

Zhu Changluo's eyes lit up, quickly taking the osmanthus wine, carefully opening the lid. A rich osmanthus fragrance mixed with the aroma of rice wine rushed out, clear and sweet, the fragrance pure, without the slightest impurity, making him couldn't help but praise: "What a fragrance! Ninth Brother's craftsmanship is getting better and better. This fragrance is even stronger than last year's."

He took a deep breath, his face showing an intoxicated expression. He had someone bring two small porcelain cups, which were made of white porcelain with a fine texture and even glaze, painted with faint orchid patterns. The orchids were lifelike, elegant and refined, specially made by Zhu Changlan, saying they best matched the sweetness of osmanthus wine. Zhu Changluo picked up a porcelain cup, putting it under his nose to smell it. The clear fragrance of the porcelain cup mixed with the fragrance of osmanthus wine,

Zhu Changluo poured two cups of osmanthus wine, handing one to Zhu Changlan: "Come, let's have a good drink today, just the two of us."

Zhu Changlan took the wine cup, clinking it with the Crown Prince's, then taking a shallow sip. The sweet wine liquid slid down his throat, carrying the elegant fragrance of osmanthus and the richness of rice wine, warm but not strong. It slid down his throat, making his whole body feel warm. Looking at the smile on the Crown Prince's face, his heart was full of happiness. In this deep palace, having such a brother who treated him sincerely, having such a pleasant time, was the greatest satisfaction for him.

The two drank osmanthus wine while chatting, from poetry to calligraphy and painting, from the flowers and plants in the palace to interesting things outside the palace. The Crown Prince talked about the new performer in the west city acrobatic troupe, who could swallow swords and breathe fire, attracting people to watch; he also talked about the storyteller in the south city teahouse, whose "Legend of Jianghu Heroes" was so exciting that people couldn't stop listening. Zhu Changlan listened with great interest, occasionally letting out a few chuckles, his eyes full of yearning. He hadn't left the palace for too long, and was full of curiosity about the outside world.

"When the court is stable in the future, I will allow you to travel outside the palace."

Looking at his yearning expression, Zhu Changluo said with a smile, "At that time, I will prepare enough travel expenses for you, so you can go wherever you want, stay as long as you want. You can go to Kunlun Mountain to see the snow scenery you've been thinking about, go to the south of the Yangtze River to taste the osmanthus cakes there, go to the seaside to see the fish schools you like."

Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up, a look of excitement appearing on his face: "Really? Elder Brother, you can't lie to me."

He had always wanted to travel around the world, see the famous mountains and great rivers outside, taste the food from all over the place, and make like-minded friends. That was his long-cherished wish.

"Of course it's true."

Zhu Changluo said with a smile, his eyes gentle and firm, "When have I ever lied to you? When I stabilize the court, get rid of those treacherous villains, I'll go with you. The two of us, traveling together, enjoying the mountains and rivers, drinking wine and chatting—wouldn't that be wonderful?"

Zhu Changlan laughed happily, like a child who had received candy. He imagined the scene of traveling with the Crown Prince: riding horses, carrying swords, traveling all over the famous mountains and great rivers, watching the snow scenery under Kunlun Mountain, admiring lotus flowers in the water towns of the south, listening to the sound of waves by the sea, and finding a small tavern at night, ordering a few side dishes, drinking the osmanthus wine he brewed himself, chatting—that would be such a pleasant thing.

Unknowingly, the sun had risen to the top of the sky. Little Happiness came in to report that lunch was ready, asking the Prince and the Ninth Prince to move to the side hall for the meal.

Zhu Changlan and Zhu Changluo stood up, walking towards the side hall. On the dining table in the side hall, there were already many sumptuous dishes, both rare delicacies and light home-cooked dishes, clearly considering both of their tastes. Steamed fish, white-cut chicken, stir-fried seasonal vegetables, winter melon and kelp soup, as well as Zhu Changlan's favorite crab meat soup dumplings and almond pudding—each dish was exquisite and delicious.

"These are all your favorite dishes, try them quickly."

Zhu Changluo said with a smile, picking up a piece of steamed fish for Zhu Changlan. This fish was a crucian carp freshly fished from the imperial river that morning, with tender meat. The Crown Prince specially instructed the chef to use less seasoning, only ginger slices to remove the fishy smell, to retain the fish's natural freshness to the greatest extent.

Zhu Changlan nodded, picking up his chopsticks, slowly savoring it. The fish meat was tender, melting in the mouth, with a faint fresh fragrance, exactly the taste he liked. He ate happily, and when he was with the Crown Prince, he always felt unprecedentedly relaxed and comfortable, not needing to pretend, not needing to guard, being able to be himself completely.

After lunch, Zhu Changluo took Zhu Changlan to visit the Eastern Palace's garden. The Eastern Palace's garden was much larger than Tranquility Palace's, with all kinds of exotic flowers and rare plants. Peonies bloomed gracefully and luxuriously, roses bloomed with charming beauty, orchids bloomed with elegant purity, and there were many other flowers Zhu Changlan couldn't name, competing to bloom, beautiful beyond compare. In the center of the garden was a small lake, with a few lotus leaves floating on the lake surface. Occasionally, a few red koi fish swam by, flicking their tails, creating ripples, appearing particularly lively.

"I designed this garden myself."

Zhu Changluo said with a smile, his tone with a hint of pride, "When I have free time, I come here to walk around, looking at the flowers and plants, and my mood becomes much more relaxed."

He pointed to a magnolia tree by the lake, saying: "This magnolia tree was planted by me when I first entered the Eastern Palace, and now it's grown so big."

Following the Crown Prince's finger, Zhu Changlan saw that the magnolia tree was lush with leaves, its trunk thick, and its branches full of white magnolia flowers, like white clouds hanging on the branches, exceptionally beautiful. The petals were as white as snow, emitting a faint fragrance, which drifted with the wind, refreshing the heart.

"Time flies so fast, in the blink of an eye, we brothers have known each other for so many years."

Zhu Changluo said with emotion, his eyes with a hint of reminiscence, "I still remember when you first entered the palace, you were so small, timid, hiding when you saw people, not even daring to speak. Now, you've grown up so much, becoming more and more steady."

Zhu Changlan looked at the magnolia tree, then at the Crown Prince, feeling a wave of emotion in his heart. He remembered when he first entered the palace after reincarnation, he was young and ignorant, full of fear of this unfamiliar world. It was the Crown Prince who had always taken care of him, teaching him to read and write, teaching him how to behave in the world, protecting him when he was bullied, accompanying him when he was lonely. Over the years, the Crown Prince had been like a beacon, illuminating his path in the deep palace, giving him warmth and support.

"Elder Brother, thank you."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince, sincerely saying. This thank you contained too much gratitude, too much emotion.

Zhu Changluo smiled, patting his shoulder: "We are brothers, no need to thank me."

He paused, his eyes becoming exceptionally gentle, "No matter what happens in the future, don't forget that you still have me, your Elder Brother. I will always protect you, forever."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his eyes slightly moist. The Crown Prince's promise was as heavy as Mount Tai. In this deep palace, with the Crown Prince's words, he was not afraid of anything. No matter how many storms and obstacles he would encounter in the future, he had the courage to face them.

The two strolled around the garden for a while longer, chatting about past interesting things, talking about future expectations. Zhu Changlan talked about his clumsiness when he first learned to transform into human form, about the comfort of sunbathing and catching fish under Kunlun Mountain, about the surprise of drinking osmanthus wine for the first time. The Crown Prince listened with great interest, occasionally letting out a few chuckles, his eyes full of fondness.

The sun set in the west, and the sky was dyed red by the sunset glow, turning the entire Eastern Palace into warm yellow. Zhu Changlan knew it was time for him to return to Tranquility Palace. He looked at the Crown Prince reluctantly, saying: "Elder Brother, I should go back."

Zhu Changluo nodded, a gentle smile on his face: "Okay, I'll see you off."

The two walked out of the Eastern Palace side by side. Along the way, they didn't speak, but they silently felt the reluctance in each other's hearts. The crabapple flowers on both sides of the palace path were still falling, like a gentle farewell.

At the palace gate, Zhu Changlan stepped onto the carriage, turning back to look at the Crown Prince, saying: "Elder Brother, you should also go back and rest early, don't overwork yourself. No matter how many court affairs there are, you should pay attention to your body."

"I know."

Zhu Changluo nodded, his eyes full of concern, "Be careful on the way. When you return to Tranquility Palace, send someone to let me know, so I can rest assured."

"Okay." Zhu Changlan replied.

The carriage slowly moved forward, and Zhu Changlan sat in the carriage, lifting the curtain, watching the Crown Prince's figure gradually recede into the distance, his heart full of reluctance. He wondered when he would be able to chat and drink with the Crown Prince like this again. In the deep palace, people couldn't help themselves. The Crown Prince had his responsibilities and missions, and he also had his own secrets and ties. Such time seemed particularly precious.

When he returned to Tranquility Palace, it was already dark. Little Salary had already prepared dinner, along with a pot of warm rice wine. Zhu Changlan sat at the dining table, but didn't have much appetite. His mind was filled with the scenes of being with the Crown Prince—the Crown Prince's gentle smile, sincere eyes, thoughtful care, and that sentence "I will always protect you."

He picked up the wine pot, pouring himself a cup of rice wine, taking a shallow sip. The aroma of the rice wine filled his mouth, but it couldn't compare to the warmth in his heart. In this cold deep palace, the Crown Prince's warmth was the most precious thing in his life, the strength that supported him through long years.
