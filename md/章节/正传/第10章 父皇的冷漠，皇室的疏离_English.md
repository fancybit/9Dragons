Chapter 10: The Emperor's Indifference, the Imperial Family's Estrangement

The 25th year of the Wanli era of the Great Ming Dynasty, late spring.

On the tenth day since Zhu Changlan and his party went deep into the Ten Thousand Great Mountains of Southern Border to track the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader's soul, the morning light of the imperial palace in the capital still followed the old rules, penetrating through layers of palace walls and branches, casting fragmented light spots on the white marble steps in front of the Qianqing Palace. But although this morning light was warm, it seemed unable to penetrate the heavy twilight hanging over the palace, let alone warm the estrangement and indifference flowing in the imperial blood.

Inside the Qianqing Palace, the incense burner burned top-quality sandalwood, and smoke curled upward, wrapping around the silent monarchs and ministers in the hall. Emperor Wanli Zhu Yijun sat on the high dragon throne, his face becoming more dignified against his bright yellow dragon robe, but there was no warmth in his deep eyes, only weighing and scrutiny. He held a report delivered by fast horse from Southern Border in his hand, his fingertips caressing the yellowed paper, and remained silent for a long time.

Kneeling below the hall was the leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei responsible for transmitting news from Southern Border. His head hung low, beads of sweat seeping from his forehead, and even his breath was extremely light. Since Zhu Changlan left the capital, he had sent back updates on the investigation every three days, but every time he faced the emperor, he felt the emperor's piercing indifference, which was more suffocating than the miasma of Southern Border.

"In other words, the Ninth Prince has already killed the monsters at the two Black Bone Sect strongholds in Black Wind Forest and Black Wind Valley, and has now gone deep into the Ten Thousand Demon Cave to investigate?" After a long time, Zhu Yijun finally spoke slowly, his voice flat and emotionless, not showing the slightest concern, but rather asking about a trivial political matter.

"Returning to Your Majesty, that is correct." The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei replied respectfully, "Prince Jiu used the fish bait strategy to successively destroy two strongholds of the Black Bone Sect, killing several core monsters such as the thousand-year-old poisonous-clawed centipede and the five-hundred-year-old lion-headed demon. Currently, he has broken through the first line of defense of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, killed the thousand-year-old scaled lizard demon, and is going deep into the cave to track the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader's soul. Daoist Xuan Chen and twenty elite Jinyiwei dark division members have always been providing support from the periphery, and there is no immediate danger to their lives."

Zhu Yijun responded with an "Hmm" and did not ask further, casually throwing the report on the dragon case beside him. The report landed among a mountain of memorials, making a slight sound, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea, not stirring the slightest emotional ripple in him. Silence again fell over the hall, and the scent of sandalwood became thicker, but it made people feel chest tight and short of breath.

Seeing this scene, Grand Secretary Zhang, standing at the side of the hall, sighed inwardly. He had followed Zhu Yijun for many years and knew the emperor's temperament well. The emperor's heart was unfathomable and as cold as ice. Especially towards his princes, Zhu Yijun had never shown the warmth of an ordinary father, only seeing them as tools for utilization and checks and balances. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was gentle and benevolent, but had never gained the emperor's complete trust; the Third Prince Zhu Changxun was ambitious, had previously colluded with Consort Zheng in an attempted rebellion, and was deposed and placed under house arrest; while the Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, weak since childhood and with demonic powers, had never been in Zhu Yijun's eyes. If it weren't for the fact that this matter concerning the Black Bone Sect was related to the source of the spiritual veins and the foundation of the dynasty, Zhu Yijun would never have agreed to let him go to Southern Border personally.

"Your Majesty," Grand Secretary Zhang stepped forward, cupping his hands, "the Ninth Prince has gone deep into danger, tracking down the demons and evil spirits, dedicating himself to the safety of the dynasty. Now that he has broken through the defense of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave and is only one step away from the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, I believe we should immediately dispatch reinforcements from the Southern Border garrison to assist the Ninth Prince, ensuring everything goes smoothly."

Zhu Yijun looked at Grand Secretary Zhang with indifferent eyes: "Reinforcements? No need."

Grand Secretary Zhang was taken aback, then quickly said: "Your Majesty, the Ten Thousand Demon Cave is extremely dangerous, infested with countless thousand-year-old monsters. The Ninth Prince, relying only on his own strength and Daoist Xuan Chen, may be unable to handle it. If there is any mishap, not only will we be unable to eliminate the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, but we will also lose a prince, which would be a loss of face for the dynasty."

"Face?" Zhu Yijun curled his lips into a cold smile, "If my prince cannot even handle this level of danger, it is not a pity if he dies." He paused, his tone becoming even more indifferent, "Furthermore, the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader are still injured, and Zhu Changlan has the body of a Snow Spirit Cat and the assistance of Daoist Xuan Chen. He may not be without a chance of victory. Let him test himself, and we will see if he is worthy of my mobilizing troops for him."

These words sent a chill through everyone in the hall. The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei trembled slightly. He thought of Zhu Changlan fighting bloody battles in Southern Border, of the bodies of Jinyiwei dark division members torn apart by monsters, and compared it to the emperor's indifference at this moment, a feeling of unspeakable sadness welled up in his heart. Grand Secretary Zhang also frowned, wanting to persuade again, but was stopped by Zhu Yijun's cold gaze.

"I have decided on this matter, no further discussion." Zhu Yijun said in a deep voice, "Transmit my decree: the Southern Border garrison shall stay in place and shall not mobilize without authorization. As for the Ninth Prince, let him investigate on his own. If he can successfully eliminate the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, it will be a great achievement; if he fails, he can only blame his own incompetence."

"Your Majesty..." Grand Secretary Zhang wanted to speak, but saw Zhu Yijun wave his hand, signaling him to withdraw. Helpless, Grand Secretary Zhang could only bow and leave the Qianqing Palace with the leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei.

The moment the hall door closed, the dignity on Zhu Yijun's face gradually faded, leaving only deep exhaustion and complexity. He walked to the dragon case, picked up the discarded report, his fingertips brushing over the words "Zhu Changlan," his eyes dark and unclear. In fact, he was not completely indifferent to this son, but in the royal family, warmth had always been the most luxurious thing. He was an emperor, and the first thing he had to consider was the stability and continuity of the dynasty, not father-son affection. Zhu Changlan, with his demonic powers, was an anomaly in the royal family. If he could not prove his value, he would sooner or later become a hidden danger to the dynasty. Letting him go to Southern Border this time was both to eliminate the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader and a test for him. It was just that this test was cruel to the point of being heartless.

Zhu Yijun put down the report and looked out the window. In the courtyard of the Qianqing Palace, several ancient cypresses were lush and green, and sunlight filtered through the branches, forming dappled shadows on the ground. He remembered Zhu Changlan's childhood appearance, a small, thin figure, every time he saw him, he would timidly hide behind his wet nurse, not daring to approach. At that time, he had also felt a trace of emotion, but this emotion was quickly overwhelmed by the emperor's responsibilities and suspicions. Now Zhu Changlan had grown up, with his own abilities and responsibilities, but the distance between them had grown further and further.

At the same time, in the Eastern Palace, Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was anxiously waiting for news from Southern Border. He paced back and forth in his study, holding a jade pendant in his hand. This jade pendant was what he and Zhu Changlan had sought together when they were young, symbolizing their brotherly bond. Since Zhu Changlan left the capital, he had lost his appetite and worried day and night. Although the news Zhu Changlan sent back each time was fairly smooth, he knew better than anyone the dangers of the Ten Thousand Great Mountains of Southern Border.

"Your Highness, the leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei has returned from the Qianqing Palace." The eunuch reported softly.

Zhu Changluo's eyes lit up, and he quickly said: "Let him in!"

The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei entered the study, bowed, and said: "Greetings, Crown Prince."

"How is Ninth Brother? Did Father issue any decrees?" Zhu Changluo quickly asked, his tone filled with concern.

The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei reported to Zhu Changluo in detail what had happened in the Qianqing Palace, including Zhu Changlan's investigation progress and the emperor's decision to refuse sending reinforcements.

After hearing the report, Zhu Changluo's face immediately turned dark, and the jade pendant in his hand was squeezed tightly, his knuckles turning white. "How can Father be so indifferent!" He couldn't help but growl, "Ninth Brother has gone deep into the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, in great danger, but Father not only refuses to send reinforcements, but also says 'it's not a pity if he dies'. Is this father-son affection?"

The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei lowered his head, not daring to answer. The Crown Prince had a deep brotherly bond with the Ninth Prince, and he understood the Crown Prince's anger at this moment, but they could not disobey the emperor's decree.

Zhu Changluo took a deep breath, trying to calm his emotions. Anger was useless; the most urgent thing was to find a way to support Zhu Changlan. "Leader of the dark division, you immediately take people to Southern Border and give this military talisman to Ninth Brother." Zhu Changluo took out a military talisman from his arms and handed it to the leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei, "This is the military talisman I secretly use to mobilize the Eastern Palace guards. Although the number of soldiers is not large, it can still help Ninth Brother. Tell Ninth Brother to be sure to take care of himself. If things are impossible, withdraw immediately and do not fight recklessly."

The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei took the military talisman, bowed, and said: "This subordinate obeys! Your Highness, rest assured, this subordinate will definitely deliver the military talisman safely to Prince Jiu."

After the leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei left, Zhu Changluo sat alone in his study, his eyes filled with exhaustion and helplessness. As the Crown Prince, he seemed extremely noble, but he couldn't even protect his own brother. The emperor's indifference, the imperial family's estrangement, were like an invisible net, tightly wrapping around him, making him breathless. He remembered his childhood, when he, Zhu Changlan, and Zhu Changxun played together in the Imperial Garden. At that time, although they also had disputes, they also had simple happiness. But as they grew older, the royal struggles and the emperor's suspicions gradually corrupted this brotherly bond. Zhu Changxun was ambitious and eventually embarked on the path of rebellion; while he and Zhu Changlan, although still deeply affectionate, had to be on guard against open and hidden arrows from around them.

"Your Highness, Consort Zheng has sent someone." The eunuch reported again.

Zhu Changluo frowned, a trace of disgust welling up in his heart. The current Consort Zheng was newly appointed, from a prestigious family, but she was narrow-minded and bent on making her son the Crown Prince. Since Zhu Changlan left the capital, she had repeatedly spoken ill of Zhu Changlan in front of the emperor, trying to sow discord.

"Let her in." Zhu Changluo said in a deep voice.

The personal maid of Consort Zheng entered the study, bowed, and said: "Greetings, Crown Prince. Upon hearing that the Ninth Prince is progressing smoothly in Southern Border, Consort Zheng specially asked this servant to bring some tonics to replenish Your Highness's health." With that, she placed an exquisite food box on the table.

Zhu Changluo glanced at the food box, his tone cold: "Thank Consort Zheng for me on my behalf. Leave the tonics, you can go back."

The maid responded, but did not leave immediately, hesitatingly saying: "Your Highness, Consort Zheng also asked this servant to tell you that the Ninth Prince has demonic powers, and this time he went deep into the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, fearing that he will be corrupted by demonic energy and his nature will change drastically. Currently, many ministers in the court have submitted memorials, requesting Your Majesty to restrict the Ninth Prince's power to prevent any accidents. Consort Zheng hopes that Your Highness can take the overall situation of the dynasty as the most important thing and persuade Your Majesty to recall the Ninth Prince to the capital as soon as possible."

"Presumptuous!" Zhu Changluo slammed the table, angrily shouted, "Ninth Brother is risking his life, going deep into danger for the safety of the dynasty, and Consort Zheng not only does not appreciate his contributions, but also stirs up trouble here, sowing discord. What is her intention?"

The maid was so frightened that she trembled all over, quickly kneeling down: "Your Highness, please calm down. This servant is only following orders to pass on the message, and does not dare to speak a single false word."

"Get out!" Zhu Changluo coldly said.

The maid was granted amnesty, quickly got up, and fled the study in a panic.

Looking at the maid's departing figure, Zhu Changluo's face became even more ugly. Consort Zheng's words were not baseless. Many ministers in the court were indeed wary of Zhu Changlan's demonic powers. Now that Zhu Changlan had made military achievements in Southern Border and his power was growing, these people were even more restless. And the emperor's indifference had just given these people an opportunity.

He walked to the window and looked into the depths of the palace. There was the center of power, but also a cold cage. In the royal family, there is no eternal family affection, only eternal interests. He didn't know where this conspiracy against Zhu Changlan would ultimately lead; he also didn't know if his brotherly bond with Zhu Changlan could withstand the royal family's indifference and estrangement.

At the same time, the former Consort Zheng and the deposed Crown Prince Zhu Changxun, who were under house arrest in the Cold Palace, also received news of Zhu Changlan in Southern Border.

Inside the Cold Palace, the environment was simple, filled with the musty smell of dampness everywhere. The former Consort Zheng was wearing a plain prison uniform, her hair messy, no longer the graceful and luxurious appearance of the past. She sat on the cold stone bed, listening to the news from her confidant maid, a trace of venom flashing in her eyes.

"This little bastard Zhu Changlan is really lucky!" The former Consort Zheng gritted her teeth and said, "I didn't expect that with his demonic powers, not only was he not executed, but he also made military achievements. If he comes back safely, our mother and son will have no hope at all."

The deposed Crown Prince Zhu Changxun sat aside, his face gloomy. After being deposed, he had been under house arrest in the Cold Palace, and his former ambition and pride had long been消磨 away, leaving only endless resentment. "Mother, rest assured, Zhu Changlan will never have a good end." Zhu Changxun's voice was hoarse and cold, "The Ten Thousand Demon Cave is extremely dangerous, even if he can escape the attacks of monsters, he cannot escape the plots of ministers in the court. Moreover, Father has always been wary of him. As long as we add fuel to the fire, we can make him discredited and die without a burial place."

The former Consort Zheng nodded, a trace of hope flashing in her eyes: "Ze'er, what's your plan?"

Zhu Changxun leaned close to the former Consort Zheng and whispered: "Mother, we can secretly contact the ministers in the court who are dissatisfied with Zhu Changlan, let them submit memorials to Your Majesty, falsely accusing Zhu Changlan of colluding with the Black Bone Sect and using demonic powers to do evil. Then spread rumors that Zhu Changlan has been corrupted by demonic energy, his nature has changed drastically, and he intends to rebel. Father is naturally suspicious, as long as we do it seamlessly, we can make Father believe our words and order Zhu Changlan to be executed."

A trace of ruthlessness flashed in the former Consort Zheng's eyes: "Good! Do as you say. No matter what the cost, we must get rid of Zhu Changlan! As long as Zhu Changlan is dead, there is still hope for the Crown Prince's position, and our mother and son can see the light of day again!"

The mother and son looked at each other, their eyes filled with venom and calculation. They didn't know that their conspiracy would not only bring a fatal crisis to Zhu Changlan, but also drag the entire royal family into a deeper abyss.

A few days later, a storm against Zhu Changlan indeed arose in the court. Many ministers jointly submitted memorials, falsely accusing Zhu Changlan of colluding with the Black Bone Sect, using demonic powers to harm living beings, and intending to rebel. At the same time, various rumors about Zhu Changlan spread in the capital, saying that he had been corrupted by the demonic energy of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave and had become a bloodthirsty monster.

Inside the Qianqing Palace, Zhu Yijun looked at the mountain of memorials, his face so dark that it could drip water. Most of these memorials and rumors were untrue, but the suspicion in his heart grew like weeds. Zhu Changlan's demonic powers had always been a thorn in his heart, and now with so many ministers submitting memorials, he had to re-examine Zhu Changlan.

"Your Majesty," Grand Secretary Zhang once again advised, "these memorials and rumors are obviously intentional, intending to frame the Ninth Prince. The Ninth Prince risked his life in Southern Border, eliminating demons and evil for the dynasty, and made outstanding achievements. How can he be slandered with these false accusations? I implore Your Majesty to see through the truth and return the Ninth Prince's innocence."

"See through the truth?" Zhu Yijun coldly said, "Grand Secretary Zhang, how do you know these are all false accusations? Zhu Changlan has demonic powers, which are different from ordinary people. Who can guarantee that he has not been corrupted by demonic energy and has no different intentions?"

Grand Secretary Zhang's heart turned cold, never expecting that the emperor would really have suspicions about the Ninth Prince. "Your Majesty, I still understand the character of the Ninth Prince. He is gentle and benevolent, loyal and devoted, and will never do such heinous things. Moreover, Daoist Xuan Chen went to Southern Border with him. Daoist Xuan Chen is a virtuous man of Qingyun Temple, upright and honest. If the Ninth Prince really had different intentions, he would have reported to Your Majesty immediately."

"Daoist Xuan Chen?" Zhu Yijun snorted coldly, "He is just a Taoist priest, how can he know the险恶ness of human hearts? If Zhu Changlan really wants to rebel, he will naturally have a way to bribe him."

Grand Secretary Zhang wanted to persuade again, but saw Zhu Yijun wave his hand: "Enough, I have my own decision on this matter. Transmit my decree: suspend all powers of the Ninth Prince, order him to return to the capital immediately to accept investigation. If he dares to disobey the decree, he will be charged with rebellion."

"Your Majesty! This is absolutely impossible!" Grand Secretary Zhang urgently said, "The Ninth Prince is currently in the hinterland of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, having found the secret room where the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader are dormant. He is about to launch an attack, but received the emperor's decree."

"Consequences?" Zhu Yijun's eyes were cold, "I only know that if Zhu Changlan continues to stay in Southern Border and allows his power to grow, the consequences will be more serious. As for the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, he is just a defeated dog, even if he counterattacks, he can't stir up any waves."

Looking at Zhu Yijun's cold face, Grand Secretary Zhang felt a deep sense of powerlessness. Once the emperor makes a decision, it is difficult to change. This conspiracy against Zhu Changlan has successfully shaken the emperor's trust in Zhu Changlan.

The decree was soon delivered to Southern Border. At this time, Zhu Changlan had just gone deep into the hinterland of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave and found the secret room where the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader were dormant. He was about to launch an attack when he received the emperor's decree.

"Prince, His Majesty has ordered you to return to the capital immediately to accept investigation, and has also suspended all your powers." The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei held the decree, his tone heavy.

Zhu Changlan was stunned. He took the decree and read it carefully, a trace of disbelief and deep disappointment flashing in his eyes. He had fought bloody battles in Southern Border, risking his life, just to eliminate the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader and protect the safety of the dynasty. But in the end, what he got was his father's suspicion and distrust, a cold decree and investigation.

"Hahaha......" Zhu Changlan suddenly laughed, his laughter full of sorrow and mockery, "The emperor's indifference, the imperial family's estrangement, I finally experienced it today. In my life, Zhu Changlan has been worthy of the dynasty, worthy of the emperor, but in the end, I ended up with the charge of collaborating with the enemy and rebelling."

Daoist Xuan Chen stepped forward, comforting him: "Prince, His Majesty must have been deceived by treacherous people. You must not be impulsive, return to the capital first, explain to His Majesty clearly, and everything will come to light."

Zhu Changlan shook his head, his eyes firm: "Explain? Since His Majesty has already issued the decree, it means he no longer trusts me. Even if I return to the capital, I may not be able to explain clearly. Moreover, the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader are right in front of me, how can I give up the opportunity to eliminate him because of this decree? If I let him escape, he will definitely make a comeback in the future, causing greater harm."

"But Prince, disobeying the decree is rebellion!" The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei urgently said.

"Rebellion?" Zhu Changlan's eyes were cold, "I, Zhu Changlan, have dedicated my life to the country, what fear do I have of the name of rebellion? Today, even if I disobey the decree, I must completely eliminate the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader!"

With that, Zhu Changlan gripped tightly his wooden sword, his demonic powers surging around him, and rushed towards the depths of the secret room. Daoist Xuan Chen and the Jinyiwei dark division members no longer hesitated, following closely behind Zhu Changlan. They knew that Zhu Changlan's decision was correct, even if they had to face the emperor's wrath, they would fight side by side with Zhu Changlan to eliminate the demons and evil.

Inside the secret room, the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader had already noticed the movement outside. He floated in mid-air, surrounded by black qi, a trace of triumph flashing in his eyes. "Zhu Changlan, I didn't expect you to have such a day!" The remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader's voice was hoarse and cold, "The emperor's suspicion of you, the imperial family's estrangement, are all plotted by me. I just want to make you abandoned by everyone and let you die in despair!"

Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, and he coldly said: "So it's you who is behind the scenes! Black Bone Sect Leader, today is your death day!"

"Death day?" The remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader sneered, "Zhu Changlan, you are too naive. Do you think you can defeat me with your own strength? Moreover, you are now bearing the charge of rebellion. Even if you kill me, you can't escape the emperor's pursuit."

"Even if I am shattered to pieces, I will drag you to hell with me!" Zhu Changlan roared, his wooden sword emitting golden demonic energy, stabbing fiercely at the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader.

The remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader was not to be outdone, his black qi surging around him, condensing into a huge bone sword, meeting Zhu Changlan's attack.

"Clang!" The golden demonic energy collided with the black evil qi, emitting a dazzling light. The walls of the secret room shook under the impact, and fragments of stone fell one after another.

A fierce battle thus began. Zhu Changlan and the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader fought fiercely, golden demonic energy and black evil qi intertwining and colliding in the secret room, emitting dazzling light. Daoist Xuan Chen and the Jinyiwei dark division members assisted from the side, continuously launching attacks on the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, trying to pin him down.

The battle lasted for a full day and night. Both Zhu Changlan and the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader consumed a lot of energy and were seriously injured. Zhu Changlan's mouth kept bleeding, his strong outfit was already stained with blood, but his eyes were still firm, and he never let go of the wooden sword in his hand.

"Zhu Changlan, you can't hold on anymore!" The remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader panted, a trace of madness flashing in his eyes, "Today, you and I will die together!" With that, his black qi suddenly surged, rushing towards Zhu Changlan, wanting to die together with him.

Zhu Changlan's eyes condensed, and he made a difficult decision in his heart. He suddenly pushed away Daoist Xuan Chen and the Jinyiwei dark division members, his demonic powers bursting to the extreme, and golden light wrapped his entire body. "Black Bone Sect Leader, you休想 drag me to die with you!" Zhu Changlan roared, his wooden sword stabbing fiercely at the core of the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader.

"Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately stabbed into the core of the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, and golden demonic energy instantly poured in, frantically strangling the soul of the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader. The remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader let out a shrill scream, his black qi quickly dissipated, and finally turned into a wisp of green smoke, completely disappearing in the secret room.

After eliminating the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, Zhu Changlan could no longer support himself, his body softened, and he fell down. Daoist Xuan Chen and the Jinyiwei dark division members quickly stepped forward and helped him up.

"Prince, are you okay?" Daoist Xuan Chen asked with concern.

Zhu Changlan weakly shook his head, a trace of relief flashing in his eyes: "I'm okay...... The remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader has been eliminated...... The safety of the dynasty...... is no longer in danger......"

At this moment, a burst of dense footsteps came from outside the secret room. The leader of the dark division of the Jinyiwei's face changed, and he quickly said: "Prince, it's not good, it's the imperial army sent from the capital! They are here to arrest you by decree!"

Zhu Changlan's face instantly turned pale. An even greater crisis was waiting for him. The emperor's indifference, the imperial family's estrangement, finally pushed him into the abyss.

The imperial army soon rushed into the secret room, surrounding Zhu Changlan and his group. The leader of the imperial army held the imperial decree, and coldly said: "Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, you disobeyed the decree and are suspected of rebellion. Come with me to the capital immediately to accept investigation!"

Supported by the Jinyiwei dark division members, Zhu Changlan struggled to stand up. He looked at the leader of the imperial army, his eyes calm and firm: "I, Zhu Changlan, have lived my life without shame to heaven, without shame to the dynasty. I can go back to the capital with you, but I will prove my innocence to Father."

With that, Zhu Changlan no longer resisted, allowing the imperial army to put shackles on him and escort him out of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave. Daoist Xuan Chen and the Jinyiwei dark division members followed closely behind. They secretly swore that even if they risked their lives, they would protect Zhu Changlan and return his innocence.

The sun was setting, and the afterglow spilled on the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, stretching Zhu Changlan's figure very long. Behind him were the eliminated remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader, the traces of his bloody battles; in front of him were cold shackles, the emperor's indifference, and the imperial family's estrangement. He didn't know if he could prove his innocence or get out of this crisis. But no matter how difficult the road ahead was, he would not give up. Because in his heart, there was still loyalty to the dynasty, persistence in brotherly bond, and the last trace of expectation for the father-son affection that had long since passed away.

In the direction of the capital, Zhu Yijun in the Qianqing Palace was standing by the window, looking towards Southern Border. His eyes were still cold, but deep in his eyes, there was a trace of imperceptible complexity. He didn't know if his decision was right or wrong. He also didn't know how this storm caused by the imperial family's estrangement would end.

In the Eastern Palace, after learning that Zhu Changlan had been arrested by the imperial army, Zhu Changluo was extremely anxious. Once Zhu Changlan was escorted back to the capital, the consequences would be unimaginable. He had to find a way to save Zhu Changlan, no matter what the cost.

In the Cold Palace, the former Consort Zheng and the deposed Crown Prince Zhu Changxun smiled triumphantly after learning the news. They knew that their conspiracy had succeeded, and Zhu Changlan had been pushed into an irreparable abyss.

A storm surrounding Zhu Changlan was quietly brewing in the capital. The imperial family's indifference and estrangement, like an invisible net, involved everyone. And Zhu Changlan, who was in the center of the net, was stepping step by step towards that unknown fate......

The prison cart rolled over the rugged mountain roads of Southern Border, the sound of wheels rubbing against gravel emitting a piercing noise, slowly moving north, towards the direction of the capital. Zhu Changlan, wearing heavy black iron shackles, sat upright in the prison cart. The places where the shackles came into contact with his wrists and ankles had long been worn to the point of being bloody and mangled. Every bump of the cart pulled at the wounds, bringing heart-wrenching pain. But he seemed to be unaware, just slightly lowering his eyes, looking at the scenery rapidly retreating outside the prison cart. The plants of Southern Border were still lush, and the mountain wind carried moist water vapor, but this vitality was completely incompatible with his current situation. His thoughts had already drifted back to the capital, back to that magnificent but cold imperial palace. He remembered the first time he saw his father when he was a child. At that time, he had just been brought into the palace, his thin body wrapped in an ill-fitting brocade robe, looking at the majestic man on the dragon throne from a distance, his heart full of awe and expectation. He summoned the courage to go forward and say "Father, are you well?", but just after taking two steps, he was stopped by his father's cold gaze. That warm greeting, which was ultimately stuck in his throat, turned into silent cowardice. Later, he gradually grew up, learned the secret that he had demonic powers, and also understood why his father was so estranged from him - in the eyes of this emperor, he was never a son worthy of love, but a hidden danger that might threaten the stability of the dynasty. Even the time when he played with Zhu Changluo and Zhu Changxun when he was a child, now recalled, had a somewhat indescribable taste. At that time, Zhu Changluo treated him gently, would give him the sweetest snacks, and would stand up to protect him when he was bullied by other princes; while Zhu Changxun always carried a trace of hostility, and his eyes were full of contempt and jealousy when looking at him. At that time, he thought that as long as he was obedient enough and worked hard enough, he could always exchange for a trace of his father's warmth and keep this simple brotherly bond. But now it seems that all of this is just his wishful thinking. In the royal family, family affection has long been exhausted by power and suspicion, and what remains is only cold calculation and ruthless estrangement. The prison cart traveled all the way, and wherever it passed, all the people who knew his identity pointed at him, their eyes full of fear and disdain. "Is this the Ninth Prince with demonic powers? I heard that he was corrupted by demonic energy in Southern Border and even intends to rebel!" "No wonder His Majesty wants to arrest him. This kind of demon should be executed by slow and painful death to warn others!" The rumors and slander stabbed into Zhu Changlan's ears like needles, but he just slightly frowned and did not defend himself半句. Any defense at this moment is futile, under his father's suspicion and the framing of treacherous officials in the court, he has long been unable to argue. And in a place he didn't know, a conspiracy against him was quietly escalating. In the Cold Palace, after learning that Zhu Changlan had been escorted to the capital, the former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun immediately accelerated their actions. Under the pretext of visiting the former Consort Zheng, Zhu Changxun secretly contacted several ministers in the court who opposed Zhu Changlan, led by the Minister of Rites, promising them that if they could help him get rid of Zhu Changlan, he would give them high official positions and rich salaries once he regained the Crown Prince position. The Minister of Rites was already wary of Zhu Changlan's demonic powers and greedy for the wealth promised by Zhu Changxun, so he immediately agreed, secretly mobilizing people to set up an ambush at Qingfeng Ridge on Zhu Changlan's way back to the capital, intending to kill him and then forge the scene, falsely claiming that he was killed by monsters in the mountains. In the Eastern Palace, after learning that Zhu Changlan was on his way back to the capital, Zhu Changluo was even more anxious. Qingfeng Ridge was a dangerous area with steep terrain and many bandits. Now with the conspiracy of the former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun, Zhu Changlan's trip was extremely dangerous. He secretly summoned Grand Secretary Zhang overnight, and they had a long talk in the study, discussing countermeasures to rescue Zhu Changlan. "Your Highness, the Prince is now on his way back to the capital, and the road ahead is dangerous. If we don't help him, I'm afraid he won't be able to arrive in the capital alive." Grand Secretary Zhang said in a heavy tone, "But His Majesty has already issued a decree, strictly prohibiting anyone from interfering privately. What should we do?" Zhu Changluo nodded, his eyes full of determination: "Okay! Let's do as Grand Secretary Zhang says. I will immediately dispatch the elite of the Eastern Palace; the matter of collecting evidence will also trouble Grand Secretary Zhang to pay more attention. No matter what the cost, I will save Ninth Brother's life!" Grand Secretary Zhang bowed: "Your Highness, rest assured, I will do my best to protect the Ninth Prince." The night grew darker, and the lights in the Eastern Palace study were still on, reflecting Zhu Changluo and Grand Secretary Zhang's solemn faces. And in the Qianqing Palace, Zhu Yijun had not yet slept. He was alone in his study, with a secret report placed on the table, detailing the entire process of Zhu Changlan eliminating the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader in the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, and even attached evidence of the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader dissipating, sent back by Daoist Xuan Chen via fast horse. Zhu Yijun's fingertips caressed the words on the secret report, his eyes dark and unclear. He didn't expect that Zhu Changlan could really eliminate the remnants of the Black Bone Sect Leader who had caused so much harm, and he didn't expect that his son could have such great ability. But when he thought of Zhu Changlan's demonic powers, of the joint memorials of ministers in the court, of those widely circulated rumors, the suspicion in his heart once again occupied the upper hand. He was an emperor, and could not have the slightest weakness. The stability of the dynasty was always more important than father-son affection. However, when he closed his eyes, the timid appearance of Zhu Changlan when he was a child involuntarily appeared in his mind, as well as the scene of Zhu Changlan fighting bloody battles recorded in the secret report, and a trace of unspeakable complexity welled up in his heart. He didn't know how he should face this son whom he had pushed into the abyss when Zhu Changlan arrived in the capital; he also didn't know where this storm caused by the imperial family's estrangement would ultimately lead.

On the seventh day, the prison cart finally entered the territory of Qingfeng Ridge. Here, the mountains were steep, and the forests were lush. The sun was cut into pieces by the thick branches and leaves, and a faint mist filled the mountains, adding a touch of eeriness. The leader of the imperial army escorting Zhu Changlan felt a faint unease. He knew the dangers here and had already ordered the team to speed up, hoping to pass through this mountain range as soon as possible. But the more anxious he was, the faster the accident came. Just as the team was passing through a narrow mountain path, a sharp whistle suddenly sounded from both sides of the forest, and then countless black shadows rushed out from the trees, holding sharp weapons, and fiercely charged at the prison cart and the imperial army. "Ambush! Be on guard!" The leader of the imperial army roared, drawing his sword from his waist and directing the imperial army to form a defensive formation. These ambushers were all agile and fierce in their moves, obviously well-trained dead soldiers, not ordinary bandits. Their target was very clear, heading straight for the prison cart, obviously wanting to take Zhu Changlan's life. Seeing this, Daoist Xuan Chen and the Jinyiwei dark division members of Zhu Changlan immediately drew their weapons, stood in front of the prison cart, and fought with the dead soldiers. "Protect the Prince!" The leader of the Jinyiwei dark division shouted, his sword swirling in layers of sword flowers, killing a dead soldier who was rushing to the front. But the number of dead soldiers was too large, and they were fearless of death, and the imperial army and Jinyiwei dark division members soon fell into a bitter battle. Zhu Changlan sat upright in the prison cart, watching the tragic battle in front of him, his heart cold. He knew that these people were by no means bandits, but were coming for him. Apart from the former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun, he couldn't think of anyone else who would be so eager to put him to death. The weight of the black iron shackles made his limbs numb, and the pain of the wounds came again, but he could do nothing, only watching helplessly as the people around him fell one by one. Just then, a sound of horse hooves came from behind the mountain path, accompanied by a clear clinking of metal. "The Crown Prince has ordered: escort the Ninth Prince safely back to the capital!" A loud shout broke the deadlock of the battle. I saw a team of elite guards disguised as merchants galloping forward. They held the Eastern Palace token and were agile, quickly rushing into the battlefield and counterattacking the dead soldiers. These were the elite of the Eastern Palace secretly dispatched by Zhu Changluo. With their joining, the situation on the battlefield immediately reversed. Although the dead soldiers were fearless of death, under the attack of the well-trained Eastern Palace elite and imperial army, they gradually fell into a disadvantage. Seeing the situation was not good, the leader of the dead soldiers flashed a trace of ruthlessness in his eyes, took out a signal flare from his arms, and fired it into the sky. The signal flare exploded into a black firework in the air, obviously summoning reinforcements. The leader of the Jinyiwei dark division's face changed: "Not good, they still have reinforcements! We must break through as soon as possible!" Daoist Xuan Chen nodded, a faint golden light emanating from his body, and with a wave of his flywhisk, several golden talismans flew out, accurately hitting several dead soldiers and knocking them flying. "Hurry up and escort the Prince away!" Daoist Xuan Chen said in a deep voice. The leader of the imperial army immediately reacted, directing some of the imperial army to escort the prison cart, while the rest stayed behind to hold back the enemy. The prison cart started again, galloping forward along the mountain path under the escort of the Eastern Palace elite. The sounds of fighting behind gradually faded away, but Zhu Changlan's heart remained heavy. He knew that this was just the beginning of the conspiracy of the former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun. Even if he could arrive in the capital safely, a more difficult game was waiting for him.

Three days later, the prison cart finally arrived at the outskirts of the capital. From a distance, Zhu Changlan saw the familiar city, with its tall city walls towering into the sky, and the city gates heavily guarded. But this capital city, which he had once been so familiar with, now seemed like a huge cage, waiting for him to step into it.

Inside the Qianqing Palace, after learning that Zhu Changlan had arrived at the outskirts of the capital, Zhu Yijun remained silent for a long time, and finally ordered: "Temporarily imprison the Ninth Prince in the Heavenly Prison, and wait for me to find out the truth before dealing with him." This decision did not immediately punish Zhu Changlan, nor did it vindicate him, but temporarily put him aside, which was obviously a reflection of Zhu Yijun's inner contradiction.

After learning the news, Grand Secretary Zhang was slightly relieved. As long as Zhu Changlan was still alive, there was hope of clearing his grievances. He immediately found Zhu Changluo, discussing how to collect evidence as soon as possible to vindicate Zhu Changlan.

"Your Highness, now that the Prince has been imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison, we must find evidence of the former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun framing the Prince as soon as possible, otherwise there will be endless troubles." Grand Secretary Zhang said in a heavy tone.

Zhu Changluo nodded, his eyes full of determination: "Grand Secretary Zhang, rest assured, my people are already investigating, and I believe there will be results soon. In addition, I will personally go to the Heavenly Prison to visit Ninth Brother, inform him of our plan, and let him rest assured."

But Zhu Changluo's request to visit was rejected by Zhu Yijun. "As the Crown Prince, you should take the overall situation of the dynasty as the most important thing, and not neglect public affairs for personal reasons. You are not allowed to have private contact with the Ninth Prince until the matter is clarified." The emperor's decree was cold and firm, once again cutting off the connection between Zhu Changluo and Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changluo stood outside the Qianqing Palace, looking at the tightly closed palace door, his heart full of sorrow. The emperor's indifference once again made him feel the ruthlessness of the royal family. He still couldn't protect his brother after all.

Inside the Heavenly Prison, the environment was dark and damp, filled with a putrid smell everywhere. Zhu Changlan was imprisoned in a separate cell, still wearing black iron shackles, which collided with the cold stone floor, making a dull sound. He leaned against the wall, closing his eyes to rest, and his mind kept replaying the experiences of this period of time. From the bloody battles in Southern Border, to his father's suspicion and decree, and then to the ambush at Qingfeng Ridge, all of this was like a nightmare. He didn't know when his grievances would be cleared, or if he could wait until that day.

At this moment, a sound of footsteps came from outside the cell. Zhu Changlan opened his eyes and saw an eunuch walking in, holding a tray of food. "Ninth Prince, this is specially sent by Your Majesty." The eunuch placed the food on the stone platform at the cell door, his tone flat.

Zhu Changlan glanced at the food, four dishes and one soup, all his favorite flavors when he was a child. His heart moved slightly, what did his father's move mean? Guilt, or another form of temptation? He didn't eat immediately, but quietly looked at the food, his heart filled with mixed emotions.

At the same time, in the Eastern Palace, Zhu Changluo's investigation finally made progress. His people found the personal maid of the former Consort Zheng, and from her mouth learned the entire process of the former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun secretly contacting the Minister of Rites and plotting to frame Zhu Changlan, and also obtained the correspondence between them as evidence. Zhu Changluo immediately took this evidence to the Qianqing Palace, hoping to persuade his father to clear Zhu Changlan's grievances.

But when he arrived at the Qianqing Palace, he was told that the emperor was resting and would not see anyone. Zhu Changluo had no choice but to hand over the evidence to the eunuch and ask him to pass it on to his father. He stood outside the Qianqing Palace for a long time, looking at the closed palace door, his heart filled with helplessness and sadness. He didn't know if his father would see this evidence, or if he would change his mind because of it. But he had done everything he could, and the rest could only depend on fate.

In the Heavenly Prison, Zhu Changlan finally picked up the chopsticks and took a bite of the food. The taste was still the same as when he was a child, but now it was tasteless. He thought of his father's indifference, of the imperial family's estrangement, of his brother's concern, and of the conspiracy that surrounded him. His eyes gradually moistened, and a drop of tear fell into the bowl, rippling in circles.

The night was getting deeper, and the capital was shrouded in darkness. A storm was quietly brewing, and no one knew how it would end. But one thing was certain: the imperial family's indifference and estrangement had already planted the seeds of disaster, and sooner or later, they would bear bitter fruits.

End
