# Chapter 6: Imperial Physician Takes Pulse, Flaws Unavoidable

The 25th Year of Wanli, Ming Dynasty, Late Spring, Seventh Hour of the Day.

Morning light filtered through the carved window lattice of the East Palace side hall, spreading over the green brick floor, casting a warm glow on the jade lamp on the table. Zhu Changlan sat cross-legged on the bed, his fingertips caressing the warm和田 jade pendant at his waist------ The carved "Luo" character on the pendant was worn smooth, carrying the lingering warmth of the Crown Prince's palm. He had just completed a cycle of demon power circulation, golden spiritual energy flowing smoothly through his meridians, the comfort after clearing the cold stagnation still lingering, with a faint spiritual energy surrounding him like a thin veil.

"Ninth Brother, the imperial physician is here."

Crown Prince Zhu Changluo's voice came from outside the door, with a gentle smile. He wore a bright yellow daily robe, the cuffs embroidered with dark golden dragon patterns, and after handling the morning court affairs, he personally led the head of the Imperial Medical Academy into the side hall.

Zhu Changlan quickly stopped his cultivation, standing up with a light movement, the scars on his shoulder and waist already fading to almost invisible. He stepped forward, bowing in greeting: "Elder Brother."

Imperial Physician Li, the head of the Imperial Medical Academy, quickly bowed in return, his white beard gently shaking with the movement: "Greetings to Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince, Ninth Prince."

Imperial Physician Li was the most senior imperial physician in the palace, practicing medicine for over fifty years. Not only was he highly skilled in medicine, but he was also excellent at observing qi and discerning complexions. He even managed the Emperor's health, and was specially "recommended" by Consort Zheng to复诊 Zhu Changlan------ Ostensibly concerned about the "injured Ninth Prince", but actually wanting Imperial Physician Li to probe Zhu Changlan's "abnormality".

The Crown Prince naturally knew Consort Zheng's intentions, silently standing in front of Zhu Changlan, smiling and saying: "Imperial Physician Li, please carefully examine Ninth Brother. I've been worried about him after his coma these past few days."

"Your Highness is too kind; this is my duty."

Imperial Physician Li looked up, his pupils slightly constricted as they fell on Zhu Changlan's face. The Ninth Prince in front of him had a ruddy complexion and clear eyes, showing no signs of lethargy after a coma, but instead exuding an indescribable spiritual energy, as if nourished by the essence of heaven and earth. Having practiced medicine for many years, he had seen countless injured people, never having seen anyone recover so quickly after a severe injury and coma, even appearing more energetic than before the injury.

Imperial Physician Li composed himself, gesturing for Zhu Changlan to sit: "Ninth Prince, please extend your hand, I'll take your pulse."

Zhu Changlan sat down as instructed, placing his left hand on the pulse pillow. His fingertips trembled slightly, secretly on guard------
His pulse was different from that of ordinary humans, with a thousand years of demon pulse being steady and powerful, carrying a faint spiritual energy fluctuation. If detected by Imperial Physician Li, it would cause trouble. He quietly circulated a trace of demon power,伪装 his pulse to be similar to that of an ordinary person, retaining only a bit of steadiness, hoping to muddle through.

Imperial Physician Li placed his fingers on his wrist pulse, closing his eyes, his brow gradually furrowing. At first, the pulse seemed steady, no different from ordinary people, but upon careful examination, it was too steady, unlike a person who had just been severely injured and comatose for days. Instead, it was like a hermit who had cultivated for many years, with a long and unbroken internal qi. What surprised him even more was that there was a faint warm airflow in the pulse,窜 up his fingertips, carrying a clear spiritual energy, completely different from human internal strength.

"Imperial Physician Li, how is it?" The Crown Prince asked quickly when he saw his grave expression, his tone carrying appropriate concern.

Imperial Physician Li opened his eyes, looking at Zhu Changlan with a complex gaze, then at the Crown Prince, hesitantly saying: "Ninth Prince's pulse......
It's very steady, and the wounds have healed extremely well, but......"

"But what?" The Crown Prince pressed, his eyes slightly darkening.

"But this pulse is too 'healthy'."

Imperial Physician Li chose his words carefully, "Ninth Prince was severely injured and comatose, harming his internal organs. Normally, his pulse should be a bit floating, but the Prince's pulse is steady and powerful, even stronger than that of a young man, and......"
He paused, lowering his voice, "There seems to be spiritual energy flowing in the pulse, which is not the pulse of an ordinary person."

Zhu Changlan's heart sank, he was indeed detected. He forced himself to remain calm, a look of confusion on his face: "Imperial Physician Li, what do you mean by spiritual energy flowing? I've just been resting these past few days, and I've been drinking the ginseng soup Elder Brother sent, perhaps I've been well-nourished."

Imperial Physician Li shook his head, his gaze firm: "Your Highness doesn't know. No matter how much an ordinary person nourishes themselves, they won't have such clear spiritual energy. This spiritual energy......
It's more like the aura of an immortal cultivator or a demon in legends."
As soon as these words were spoken, the atmosphere in the side hall instantly became凝重.

The Crown Prince's face darkened, his tone carrying a hint of authority: "Imperial Physician Li, you can eat carelessly, but you can't speak carelessly. Ninth Brother is of royal blood, how could he be a demon? Could it be that your old eyes are failing you?"

Imperial Physician Li quickly bowed, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead: "I wouldn't dare speak recklessly, but this pulse is too abnormal. I've practiced medicine for over fifty years and have never seen anything like it."
He knew the Crown Prince was protecting Zhu Changlan, and didn't dare directly conclude, only expressing his doubts委婉ly, "Perhaps I'm old and decrepit, making a mistake. Please allow me to take the Prince's pulse again."

The Crown Prince glanced at Zhu Changlan, seeing him calm, he nodded: "Very well, take another careful look, don't make a mistake."

Zhu Changlan extended his hand again, quickly thinking of a countermeasure. He knew Imperial Physician Li was highly skilled, and if he didn't deliberately reveal some
"abnormality" without directly admitting it was a demon pulse, he might be able to muddle through. He slightly relaxed his suppression of the demon pulse, making the spiritual energy in the pulse more obvious, but controlling the strength to not be too flamboyant.

Imperial Physician Li placed his fingers on his wrist pulse again, this time feeling it more clearly. The clear spiritual energy flowed along the pulse, warm and powerful, carrying an innate nobility, not the aura of evil. He became more confused: neither an ordinary person's pulse nor the aura of an evil demon, what exactly was the Ninth Prince's background?

"How is it?" The Crown Prince's voice carried a hint of impatience.

Imperial Physician Li withdrew his hand, bowing: "Returning to Your Highness, Ninth Prince's pulse is indeed abnormal, but this spiritual energy is pure, without any evil aura. Instead, it can nourish the body. I think the Prince is naturally gifted, not possessed by demons."
He didn't dare to say the word "demon"
again, only changing the wording, "The Prince just needs to continue resting, no need to worry."

The Crown Prince breathed a sigh of relief, a smile appearing on his face: "That's good. Thank you for your trouble, Imperial Physician Li, there will be a reward."

"Thank you for Your Highness's grace."

Imperial Physician Li bowed in gratitude, his gaze still carrying a hint of inquiry, giving Zhu Changlan a deep look before turning to leave.

After Imperial Physician Li left, the atmosphere in the side hall eased slightly. The Crown Prince looked at Zhu Changlan, his tone grave: "Ninth Brother, it seems Consort Zheng won't give up easily. This time, sending Imperial Physician Li here is to probe your abnormality."

Zhu Changlan nodded, a flash of coldness in his eyes: "I know, she must have detected something."
He paused, continuing, "Imperial Physician Li is highly skilled; if I hadn't deliberately伪装, I would have been exposed."

"This matter is indeed tricky."

The Crown Prince frowned, "If Consort Zheng catches your 'abnormality' and makes a big fuss, saying you're a demon bewitching the royal family, Father恐怕 will also waver. At that time, not only will you be in danger, but I will also be implicated."

Zhu Changlan was silent for a moment, then raised his head, his gaze firm: "Elder Brother, why don't we take the initiative?"

"Oh?" The Crown Prince raised an eyebrow, "What's your idea?"

"I want to go to Qingyun Temple."

Zhu Changlan said, "The Daoist who saved me back then was the founder of Qingyun Temple. Qingyun Temple is the leader of the righteous path in the human world, always opposed to the Black Bone Sect. Moreover, the Daoists of Qingyun Temple understand immortal cultivation and can distinguish between good and evil demons. If I can get the support of Qingyun Temple to prove I'm not an evil spirit, Consort Zheng won't have any reason to make trouble."

The Crown Prince's eyes lit up: "That's a good idea. Qingyun Temple has a high reputation among the people, and even Father respects it greatly. If Daoist Xuan Qing can testify for you, Consort Zheng's conspiracy will collapse on its own."
He paused, somewhat worried, "But Qingyun Temple is far in Zhongnan Mountain, a long journey. You just recovered, and a long journey might harm your health. Moreover, there might be obstacles from Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect on the way."

"I'm fine."

Zhu Changlan said with a smile, "My injuries have already healed, and my cultivation has mostly recovered. Ordinary demons and assassins can't hurt me. Moreover, with the dagger and jade pendant Elder Brother gave me, I have nothing to fear."
He paused, continuing, "As for obstacles, it's just as well to see what手段 Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect have."

The Crown Prince looked at his determined gaze, nodding: "Very well, I approve. I'll send the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards to protect you, and prepare enough money and tokens. If you encounter trouble, you can contact local officials with the tokens."

"Thank you, Elder Brother." Zhu Changlan bowed in gratitude.

The Crown Prince helped him up, patting his shoulder: "Be careful on the way, go and return quickly. I'll wait for you in the East Palace. When you come back, we'll deal with Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect together."

1. Departure: Dark Department of the Imperial Guards Accompanying, Killing Intent Hidden

On the day Zhu Changlan departed, it was just dawn. The East Palace carriage was already prepared, the body in a low-key dark brown, the inner walls lined with soft brocade, with clothes, medicine and money prepared by the Crown Prince inside. Xiaoluzi cried like a tearful person, pulling Zhu Changlan's sleeve, reluctant to let go: "My Prince, you must take care of yourself, remember to take medicine on time, don't be stubborn when you encounter trouble, come back soon."

Zhu Changlan smiled and patted his shoulder: "Don't worry, I will. You stay in Xian'an Palace好好, and when I come back, I'll bring you specialties from Qingyun Temple."

The Crown Prince personally saw him off at the palace gate, handing him a brocade box: "Inside is the dragon-patterned jade pendant Father gave me. With this pendant, you can mobilize troops along the way, which might be useful in case of danger."
He paused, then handed him a small porcelain bottle, "Inside is the antidote pill specially made by Imperial Physician Li. The Black Bone Sect demons are good at using poison, take it with you just in case."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade box and porcelain bottle, carefully putting them away: "Elder Brother, after I leave, you must also be careful. Consort Zheng and the Third Prince will definitely take advantage of my absence to make trouble for you."

"I know."

The Crown Prince nodded, his gaze firm, "Don't worry, I'll be on guard. When you come back, we'll settle old scores together."

Zhu Changlan boarded the carriage, lifting the curtain, waving to the Crown Prince: "Elder Brother, take care."

The Crown Prince also waved, watching the carriage slowly leave the palace gate, until it disappeared at the end of the palace road, before turning back to the East Palace. He knew this journey would not be peaceful.

The carriage exited the capital, traveling west along the official road. Zhu Changlan sat in the carriage, closing his eyes to rest, circulating demon power, sensing the surrounding aura. He could feel two forces following him secretly: one was the assassins sent by Consort Zheng, and the other carried a strong black aura, Black Bone Sect demons.

"My Prince, there's a tail behind us." The voice of the leader of the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards came from outside the carriage, grave in tone.

"I know."

Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, a flash of coldness in his eyes, "Don't mind them, first see what their background is."

The carriage continued forward, and when it reached a deserted valley, the assassins and demons behind finally couldn't hold back. A dozen black-clad assassins窜出 from the dense forest on both sides of the valley, holding sharp weapons, pouncing directly on the carriage. At the same time, three Black Bone Sect demons appeared, wrapped in black aura, their faces ferocious,发出 piercing roars.

"My Prince, be careful!" The leader of the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards shouted, leading a dozen Dark Department members to meet them.

Zhu Changlan lifted the carriage curtain, looking at the battle in front of him, a cold smile curving his lips. He gripped the golden nanmu dagger at his waist, the cat's eye stone glowing blue in the sunlight. His figure flickered like a shadow, rushing out of the carriage, the dagger carrying golden demon power, pouncing directly at one of the demons.

The demon didn't expect Zhu Changlan to be so fast,来不及 react before the dagger pierced its chest. Green blood flowed from the wound, carrying a foul smell. The demon let out a scream, its body gradually turning into black aura, dissipating into the air.

Seeing this, the other two demons roared, pouncing on Zhu Changlan at the same time. Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, like a cat穿梭ing between the demons, his dagger waving imperviously, the golden demon power colliding with the black aura, making a shrill sound. The Dark Department of the Imperial Guards also fought fiercely, engaging with the black-clad assassins, blades clashing, blood splattering.

Zhu Changlan缠斗ed with the two demons for dozens of rounds, gradually understanding their moves. He found the right moment, circulating demon power, maximizing the blue light of the cat's eye stone, the dagger带着 dazzling light, stabbing the eyebrow of one of the demons. The other demon, seeing its companion killed, was terrified and turned to run.

"Want to run?"

Zhu Changlan sneered, flicking his wrist, the dagger flew out, precisely钉 on the demon's back heart. The demon fell to the ground, turning into black aura and dissipating.

After dealing with the demons, Zhu Changlan turned to look at the black-clad assassins. By now, the Dark Department had dealt with most of the assassins, and the remaining few were trembling with fear, wanting to flee. Zhu Changlan's figure flashed, catching up to one assassin, the dagger架在 his neck: "Who sent you here?"

The assassin trembled all over, his voice shaking: "It's...... it's Consort Zheng......"

"As expected."

A flash of coldness appeared in Zhu Changlan's eyes, his wrist exerting force, and the assassin fell to the ground. The remaining assassins were also dealt with by the Dark Department one by one.

After cleaning up the scene, the leader of the Dark Department came to Zhu Changlan: "My Prince, it's all dealt with."

"Hmm." Zhu Changlan nodded, retracting the dagger, "Continue on, be careful."

The carriage continued forward, and Zhu Changlan knew this was just the beginning, with more dangers waiting for him. But he felt no fear; he must reach Qingyun Temple as soon as possible, get the support of Qingyun Temple, to protect himself and the Crown Prince.

2. Qingyun Temple: Meeting an Old Friend, Revealing the Secret

After five days of long journey, Zhu Changlan finally arrived at Zhongnan Mountain. Zhongnan Mountain stretched continuously, shrouded in clouds and mist, like an ink painting. Qingyun Temple was located halfway up the mountain, with gray bricks and tiles, ancient and simple, exuding a celestial aura.

Zhu Changlan got off the carriage, letting the Dark Department wait at the foot of the mountain, while he walked alone towards Qingyun Temple. When he reached the temple gate, two young Taoist boys stopped him: "This benefactor, may I ask what brings you to Qingyun Temple?"

Zhu Changlan bowed in greeting: "Greetings, Taoist boys. I've come to visit Daoist Xuan Qing, the abbot of Qingyun Temple. Please inform him."
He took out the jet-black jade the Daoist had given him back then, handing it to the Taoist boys, "This is a token Daoist Xuan Qing gave me back then."

The Taoist boys took the jet-black jade, examined it carefully, their faces changing, quickly bowing in greeting: "So you're an old friend of Ancestor Xuan Qing. Please follow me, benefactor."

Zhu Changlan followed the Taoist boys into Qingyun Temple. The temple had towering ancient trees and a鼎盛 incense, with many pilgrims虔诚ly praying. The Taoist boys led him through the front hall to outside the meditation room at the back hall, softly saying: "Benefactor, Ancestor Xuan Qing is meditating in the room, please wait a moment."

Zhu Changlan nodded, standing outside the meditation room waiting. After a while, the door of the meditation room slowly opened, and a Daoist in white robes walked out. His beard and hair were all white, but his eyes were exceptionally clear, surrounded by a faint golden light, exactly Daoist Xuan Qing who had saved Zhu Changlan back then.

"Xuan Yu, you're here." Daoist Xuan Qing said with a smile, his tone gentle.

Zhu Changlan bowed in greeting, his eyes slightly moist: "Daoist, long time no see."

"Come in quickly."

Daoist Xuan Qing stepped aside to let him enter. The meditation room was simply furnished, with only a meditation bed, a table and a few chairs. On the table was a pot of tea, emitting curls of hot air.

The two sat down, and Daoist Xuan Qing poured him a cup of tea: "How have you been all these years?"

Zhu Changlan picked up the teacup, taking a small sip. The bitter-sweet taste reminded him of the days in the snow. He sighed, telling Daoist Xuan Qing all his experiences over the years, from the destruction of the spirit valley, wandering the human world, to borrowing a human body to become the Ninth Prince, the palace banquet assassination, and Consort Zheng's difficulties, in detail.

Daoist Xuan Qing listened quietly, his face calm. After Zhu Changlan finished, he slowly said: "Your current situation is also fate. Snow spirit cats are born with nine lives, blessed deeply, but only through trials can they achieve enlightenment."

"Daoist, I've come this time to ask for your help."

Zhu Changlan said, "Consort Zheng suspects my identity, sending the imperial physician to investigate. If I hadn't deliberately伪装, I would have been exposed. I want to ask you to testify that I'm not an evil spirit, so that Consort Zheng has no reason to make trouble."

Daoist Xuan Qing nodded: "This matter is not difficult. You're not an evil spirit, but a creature beloved by heaven and earth; I will naturally help you."
He paused, continuing, "Moreover, the Black Bone Sect has been doing evil for many years, harming living beings. Qingyun Temple has long wanted to eliminate them. Now that the Black Bone Sect has colluded with Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, plotting rebellion, it's just the right time to join forces to deal with them."

Zhu Changlan was overjoyed: "Thank you, Daoist."

"You don't need to thank me."

Daoist Xuan Qing said, "Protecting the righteous path of the human world is the duty of Qingyun Temple. Moreover, we are destined, so I won't stand by and do nothing."
He took out a talisman from his sleeve, handing it to Zhu Changlan, "This is a 'Spirit Cleansing Talisman', which can prove your identity and dispel evil spirits. Carry it with you, and if anyone questions your identity again, just show this talisman."

Zhu Changlan took the talisman, which was surrounded by a faint golden light, carrying a pure spiritual energy. He quickly bowed in gratitude: "Thank you, Daoist."

"In addition, I'll send several disciples to accompany you back to the capital."

Daoist Xuan Qing said, "They will help you deal with the Black Bone Sect demons and protect your safety."

"Thank you for your thorough consideration, Daoist." Zhu Changlan said gratefully.

The two chatted for a while longer, Daoist Xuan Qing explaining some cultivation insights to him, and teaching him a new defensive technique, which could better utilize demon power to deal with Black Bone Sect demons. Zhu Changlan listened carefully, remembering every word the Daoist said.

When leaving Qingyun Temple, Daoist Xuan Qing sent four disciples to accompany him, all elites of Qingyun Temple, with profound cultivation, good at subduing demons and eliminating evil. Zhu Changlan, accompanied by the four Daoist disciples, set off on the journey back to the capital.

3. Return Journey: Joining Forces to Defeat Enemies, First Reputation

The journey back to the capital was even more dangerous than the journey there. After learning that Zhu Changlan had gone to Qingyun Temple, Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect sent more assassins and demons, wanting to intercept and kill him halfway.

When they reached a place called "Black Wind Ridge"
, they were attacked by a large group of Black Bone Sect demons. These demons were more powerful than those encountered before, with thick black aura, ruthless attacks, and able to use evil techniques.

"Be careful, everyone!"

Zhu Changlan shouted, gripping his dagger, rushing forward first. The four Qingyun Temple disciples also immediately cast spells, golden talismans flying in the air, colliding with the demons' black aura, emitting dazzling light.

The demons let out piercing roars, pouncing one after another. Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, the dagger carrying golden demon power and the blue light of the cat's eye stone, each swing piercing a demon's vital point. The Qingyun Temple disciples formed a formation, talismans raining down, continuously attacking the demons, purifying the black aura in the air.

The battle lasted for a full hour, with demon bodies lying all over the ground, green blood staining the ground. Zhu Changlan and the four disciples also consumed a lot of spiritual energy, with more or less injuries on their bodies.

"Finally dealt with them." A disciple panted, saying.

Zhu Changlan nodded, looking at the bodies on the ground, a flash of coldness in his eyes: "Black Bone Sect demons are indeed difficult to deal with."
He took out the antidote pills the Crown Prince gave him, distributing them to the four disciples, "These are antidote pills, everyone take one, just in case."

The four disciples thanked him and took the pills, the black aura in their bodies gradually dissipating, their spirits also perked up.

After resting for a while, they continued on their way. Along the way, they encountered several more attacks, including assassins sent by Consort Zheng and Black Bone Sect demons, but they were all resolved one by one under the joint efforts of Zhu Changlan and the Qingyun Temple disciples. Zhu Changlan's reputation gradually spread along the way, and many common people knew that there was a
"Ninth Prince" leading Qingyun Temple Daoists, subduing demons and eliminating evil along the way, protecting local peace.

When they arrived at the capital, the news had already spread throughout the streets and alleys. Common people swarmed to the streets, wanting to catch a glimpse of Zhu Changlan. When Consort Zheng learned that Zhu Changlan not only returned safely but also brought Qingyun Temple disciples, becoming famous, she was so angry her face turned iron-blue, but could do nothing.

4. Court: Daoist Testifies, Consort Zheng Loses Power

Three days later, the Emperor held a court meeting in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. As expected, Consort Zheng made trouble, impeaching Zhu Changlan as
"a demon bewitching the royal family", and asked Imperial Physician Li to testify.

Imperial Physician Li bowed and said: "Your Majesty, Ninth Prince's pulse is indeed abnormal, carrying the spiritual energy of a demon. I dare not deceive Your Majesty."

Consort Zheng quickly echoed: "Your Majesty, the Ninth Prince's background is unknown, and now he possesses demon power. If he stays in the palace, he will definitely cause chaos. Please Your Majesty depose him and imprison him in the sky prison to uphold the law."

Third Prince Zhu Changxun also followed suit: "Father, what Mother said is absolutely right. Ninth Brother's background is unknown and his behavior is strange. I suspect he is a spy sent by the Black Bone Sect, intending to subvert our Ming Dynasty."

The Emperor frowned, looking at Zhu Changlan: "Ninth Brother, is this true?"

Zhu Changlan bowed in greeting: "Father, your son is not a demon. What Consort Zheng and Third Brother said are all slander."
He took out the Spirit Cleansing Talisman from his sleeve, "This is the Spirit Cleansing Talisman given by Daoist Xuan Qing of Qingyun Temple, which can prove your son's identity. Daoist Xuan Qing is the leader of the human righteous path, with high virtue and prestige. Father should believe his words, right?"

As he spoke, he handed the Spirit Cleansing Talisman to the Emperor. The Emperor took the talisman, feeling a pure spiritual energy rushing towards him, his doubts immediately dissipating a lot.

Just then, a notification came from outside the hall: "Report to Your Majesty, Daoist Xuan Qing of Qingyun Temple requests an audience."

The Emperor's heart stirred, quickly saying: "Invite him in quickly."

Daoist Xuan Qing, dressed in white, walked into the Hall of Supreme Harmony slowly, bowing in greeting: "Greetings to Your Majesty."

"Daoist, no need for formalities." The Emperor quickly stood up, personally helping him, "Why has the Daoist come today?"

"I've come today to testify for the Ninth Prince."

Daoist Xuan Qing said, "The Ninth Prince is originally a snow spirit cat from under Kunlun Mountain, born with nine lives, blessed deeply, not an evil spirit. He borrowed a human body to become the Ninth Prince, which is fate. Moreover, the Ninth Prince has a kind heart, always doing good deeds, secretly protecting the common people, and is a blessing for our Ming Dynasty."

He paused, continuing, "On the other hand, Consort Zheng and the Third Prince colluded with the Black Bone Sect, plotting rebellion, wanting to assassinate the Crown Prince, subvert the country, and harm living beings, committing heinous crimes. I have evidence here, please Your Majesty review it."
As he spoke, he took out a stack of letters from his sleeve, handing them to the Emperor.

These letters were secretly collected by Qingyun Temple disciples, detailed records of Consort Zheng, the Third Prince, and the Black Bone Sect colluding, including plans to assassinate the Crown Prince and instructions to mobilize Black Bone Sect demons.

After reading the letters, the Emperor's face turned iron-blue, slamming the table angrily: "What a vicious woman! What an unfilial son! How dare you collude with demons and plot rebellion!"

Consort Zheng and the Third Prince turned pale, quickly kneeling on the ground: "Your Majesty, this is slander!"

"Slander?"

Daoist Xuan Qing sneered, "The evidence is conclusive, how dare you quibble? The Black Bone Sect demons have already confessed, this is absolutely true."

The Emperor was furious: "Come, imprison Consort Zheng and the Third Prince in the sky prison, strictly interrogate them!"

Guards stepped forward, dragging Consort Zheng and the Third Prince away. Both cried out that they were wronged, but no one paid attention.

After the court meeting, the Emperor looked at Zhu Changlan, his gaze gentle: "Ninth Brother, you've been wronged. If it weren't for the Daoist testifying, I would have almost believed the slanderous words."

"Father, your son is not wronged."

Zhu Changlan bowed, "As long as I can clear my name, eliminate the treacherous, and protect our Ming Dynasty, your son is willing to do anything."

The Emperor nodded, growing more fond of Zhu Changlan: "Good, good, indeed my good son. From now on, you are my most trusted prince, and the East Palace Crown Prince position belongs to your elder brother, no one can shake it."

Zhu Changlan and the Crown Prince quickly bowed in gratitude: "Thank you, Father."

5. Epilogue: Dust Settles, Warmth Remains

After Consort Zheng and the Third Prince were imprisoned in the sky prison, they soon confessed to all their crimes. The Emperor was furious, issuing an edict to depose Consort Zheng's position, demote the Third Prince to commoner, and exile him to the border. The Black Bone Sect demons were also cleared by the joint efforts of Qingyun Temple disciples and the Crown Prince's Dark Department, and the capital returned to its former peace.

Zhu Changlan was conferred the title of
"Protector Prince" by the Emperor for his meritorious service in protecting the country, rewarded with countless treasures, and Xian'an Palace was expanded, its scale second only to the East Palace. After expansion, Xian'an Palace had a more exquisite layout: the main hall still hung the "Ci An" plaque, and several side rooms were added in addition to the east and west side halls, used as a study, alchemy room and library; the courtyard was doubled in size, with new plum trees and bamboo planted, complementing the original osmanthus and magnolia trees, with beautiful scenery in all seasons. However, he still liked to live a leisurely life, reading, admiring flowers, and brewing osmanthus wine in Xian'an Palace every day, occasionally gathering with the Crown Prince in the East Palace, or discussing cultivation with Qingyun Temple disciples. In spring, he would play the qin under the magnolia tree; in summer, he would cool off by the ancient well, using well water to chill watermelons; in autumn, he would pick osmanthus to brew wine; in winter, he would cook tea under the plum tree, admiring the snow while listening to the qin.

One day, Zhu Changlan was sunbathing in the courtyard of Xian'an Palace. Xiaoluzi came over with a cup of tea: "My Prince, the Crown Prince has sent a message, saying he's hosting a banquet in the East Palace tonight, asking you to come."

Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, smiling and saying: "Very well, I know."

He stood up, changing into a comfortable brocade robe, walking towards the East Palace. The setting sun shone on the palace road, stretching his shadow long. He looked at the East Palace in the distance, a gentle smile appearing on his lips.

After going through so many storms, he finally protected the people he cared about, protected this hard-won brotherhood. From now on, no one could hurt him and the Crown Prince, no one could destroy the warmth in this deep palace.

In the courtyard of the East Palace, the Crown Prince was already waiting there, the table full of sumptuous dishes and Zhu Changlan's favorite osmanthus wine. Seeing Zhu Changlan approaching, the Crown Prince smiled and stepped forward: "Ninth Brother, you're here."

"Elder Brother." Zhu Changlan smiled in response.

The two sat down, and the Crown Prince poured him a cup of osmanthus wine: "Come, let's toast to us brothers, and to this peaceful era."

Zhu Changlan raised his cup, clinking it with the Crown Prince's, taking a small sip: "Cheers."

The sweetness of the osmanthus wine spread in his mouth, like a warm current, warming his heart. He looked at the Crown Prince's gentle smile, listened to the insect chirps in the courtyard, and felt the warmth around him, his heart filled with unprecedented peace.

He knew that the most precious things in this world were not immortal cultivation or supreme power, but family by his side, sincere friendship, and this warmth protected through storms. From now on, he would cherish this hard-won happiness, protecting this Ming Dynasty with the Crown Prince, protecting this warmth, forever.
