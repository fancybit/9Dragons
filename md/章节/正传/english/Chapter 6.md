# Chapter 6: Imperial Physician's Diagnosis, Flaws Hard to Conceal

Late spring of the 25th year of the Wanli era in the Great Ming Dynasty, Chen Shi (7:00-9:00 AM).

Morning light filtered through the carved window lattice of the Side Hall of the Eastern Palace, casting a warm glow on the blue brick floor, and making the warm jade lamp on the desk emit a gentle radiance. Zhu Changlan sat cross-legged on the couch, his fingertips caressing the warm Hetian jade pendant at his waist---the engraving of the character "洛" (Luo) on the pendant had been smoothed from constant rubbing, carrying the residual warmth from the Crown Prince's palm. He had just finished circulating a cycle of demonic energy; golden spiritual energy flowed smoothly through his meridians, and the comfortable feeling after clearing the cold stagnation still lingered, with a faint layer of spiritual energy surrounding his body like a thin veil.

"Ninth Brother, the imperial physician is here."

The Crown Prince Zhu Changluo's voice came from outside the door, with a hint of gentle laughter. He was wearing a bright yellow regular robe, with dark golden dragon patterns embroidered on the cuffs. After handling the morning court affairs, he personally led the Chief Imperial Physician into the side hall.

Zhu Changlan quickly stopped his cultivation and stood up, his movements light and agile, with the scars on his shoulders and waist already faded to almost invisible. He stepped forward and bowed: "Elder Brother."

Imperial Physician Li quickly bowed in return, his white beard swaying gently with his movements: "Greetings, Crown Prince, Ninth Prince."

Imperial Physician Li was the most senior imperial physician in the palace, with over fifty years of medical practice. He was not only skilled in medicine but also extremely good at observing spiritual energy and discerning a person's condition. Even the Emperor's health was managed by him. He was specially "recommended" by Consort Zheng to give Zhu Changlan a follow-up consultation---on the surface, it was to show concern for the "injured Ninth Prince," but in reality, it was to have Imperial Physician Li investigate Zhu Changlan's "abnormalities."

The Crown Prince naturally knew Consort Zheng's intentions. He silently stepped in front of Zhu Changlan, smiling and saying: "Imperial Physician Li, please carefully examine Ninth Brother. He has been in a coma for several days, and I have been worried sick."

"Your Highness is too kind; this is my duty."

Imperial Physician Li raised his head, his eyes landing on Zhu Changlan's face, and his pupils constricted slightly. The Ninth Prince before him had a ruddy complexion and clear eyes, showing no signs of listlessness after a coma. Instead, he exuded an indescribable spiritual energy, as if nourished by the essence of heaven and earth. In his decades of medical practice, he had seen countless sick and injured people, but never had anyone recovered so quickly from a severe injury and coma, even appearing more energetic than before the injury.

Imperial Physician Li composed himself and gestured for Zhu Changlan to sit down: "Ninth Prince, please extend your hand. I will diagnose your pulse."

Zhu Changlan sat down as instructed, placing his left hand on the pulse pillow. His fingertips trembled slightly, and he was secretly vigilant---his pulse was different from that of ordinary people. His millennium demonic pulse was steady and powerful, with a faint spiritual energy fluctuation. If Imperial Physician Li detected this, it would surely cause trouble. He quietly circulated a trace of demonic energy to disguise his pulse as similar to that of a mortal, retaining only a bit of steadiness to muddle through.

Imperial Physician Li placed his fingers on Zhu Changlan's wrist, closed his eyes, and his brows gradually furrowed. At first glance, the pulse seemed steady, no different from that of an ordinary person. But upon careful examination, this pulse was too steady, far too steady for someone who had just emerged from a severe injury and coma. Instead, it was like that of a hermit who had cultivated for many years, with a long and unending internal energy. What was even more surprising was that there was a faint warm energy flowing through his fingers, carrying a clear spiritual energy completely different from mortal internal strength.

"Imperial Physician Li, how is it?" The Crown Prince saw his serious expression and asked quickly, his tone filled with appropriate concern.

Imperial Physician Li opened his eyes, his gaze complex as he looked at Zhu Changlan, then at the Crown Prince, hesitantly saying: "Ninth Prince's pulse... is quite steady, and his wounds have healed extremely well, but..."

"But what?" The Crown Prince pressed, his eyes darkening slightly.

"But this pulse is too 'healthy.'"

Imperial Physician Li chose his words carefully, "Ninth Prince was severely injured and comatose, with internal organ damage. Normally, his pulse should carry a hint of weakness, but Ninth Prince's pulse is steady and powerful, even stronger than that of a strong young man. Moreover..."

He paused, lowering his voice, "There seems to be spiritual energy surging in the pulse. This is not the pulse a mortal should have."

Zhu Changlan's heart sank; he had indeed been detected. He forced himself to remain calm, a look of confusion appearing on his face: "Imperial Physician Li, what do you mean by spiritual energy surging? I've just been resting these days and drinking the ginseng soup Elder Brother sent. Perhaps I've been over-nourished."

Imperial Physician Li shook his head, his gaze firm: "Your Highness doesn't know. No matter how much nourishment a mortal takes, their pulse won't have such clear spiritual energy. This spiritual energy... is more like the aura of immortals or demons in legends."

The atmosphere in the side hall immediately became tense.

The Crown Prince's face darkened, his tone carrying a hint of authority: "Imperial Physician Li, one can eat whatever they want, but one must be careful with their words. Ninth Brother is of royal blood; how could he be a demon? Are you getting old and seeing things?"

Imperial Physician Li quickly bowed, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead: "I dare not speak falsely, Your Highness. It's just that this pulse is too abnormal; I've never seen anything like it in my fifty years of practice."

He knew the Crown Prince was protecting Zhu Changlan and didn't dare to directly conclude anything. He could only subtly express his doubts, "Perhaps I am old and my judgment is wrong. Please allow me to diagnose Ninth Prince's pulse once more."

The Crown Prince glanced at Zhu Changlan, seeing his calm expression, and nodded: "Very well, examine him again carefully to avoid misjudgment."

Zhu Changlan extended his hand again, quickly thinking of a solution. He knew Imperial Physician Li was highly skilled in medicine, and another diagnosis would likely still reveal his secret. Instead of hiding it completely, perhaps it would be better to actively reveal some "abnormalities" but not directly admit it was a demonic pulse, which might allow him to muddle through. He slightly relaxed his suppression of the demonic pulse, allowing the spiritual energy in his pulse to become more apparent, but controlled its strength to keep it from being too ostentatious.

Imperial Physician Li placed his fingers on Zhu Changlan's wrist again, and this time he felt it more clearly. That clear spiritual energy flowed through the meridians, warm and powerful, carrying an innate nobility, definitely not the aura of evil spirits. He became even more confused. It was neither a mortal's pulse nor the aura of an evil demon; what was the Ninth Prince's true identity?

"How is it?" The Crown Prince's voice carried a hint of impatience.

Imperial Physician Li withdrew his hand and bowed: "Your Highness, Ninth Prince's pulse is indeed abnormal, but this spiritual energy is pure, without any evil aura. Instead, it nourishes the body. I think it's due to Ninth Prince's natural uniqueness, not the work of demons."

He didn't dare to use the word "demon" again, changing his wording, "Ninth Prince just needs to continue resting, no need to worry."

The Crown Prince breathed a sigh of relief, a smile appearing on his face: "That's good. Thank you for your trouble, Imperial Physician Li. Reward him."

"Thank you for Your Highness's grace."

Imperial Physician Li bowed in thanks, but his gaze still carried a hint of inquiry. He took a deep look at Zhu Changlan before turning to leave.

After Imperial Physician Li left, the atmosphere in the side hall relaxed slightly. The Crown Prince looked at Zhu Changlan, his tone serious: "Ninth Brother, it seems Consort Zheng won't give up easily. She sent Imperial Physician Li here just to investigate your abnormalities."

Zhu Changlan nodded, a cold glint flashing in his eyes: "I know. She must have sensed something."

He paused, continuing, "Imperial Physician Li is highly skilled. If I hadn't deliberately disguised it, I would have already been exposed."

"This matter is indeed tricky."

The Crown Prince frowned deeply, "If Consort Zheng catches onto your 'abnormalities' and makes a big deal out of it, claiming you're a demon bewitching the royal family, Father might also waver. At that time, not only will you be in danger, but I will also be implicated."

Zhu Changlan was silent for a moment, then looked up with firm eyes: "Elder Brother, why don't we take the initiative?"

"Oh?" The Crown Prince raised an eyebrow, "What do you have in mind?"

"I want to go to Azure Cloud Temple."

Zhu Changlan said, "The Daoist who saved me back then was the founder of Azure Cloud Temple. Azure Cloud Temple is the leader of the righteous path in the mortal world, always opposed to the Black Bone Sect. Moreover, the Daoists of Azure Cloud Temple understand the way of cultivation and can distinguish between good and evil demons. If we can gain the support of Azure Cloud Temple and prove I'm not an evil spirit, Consort Zheng will have no reason to make trouble."

The Crown Prince's eyes lit up: "That's a good idea. Azure Cloud Temple has a high reputation among the people, and even Father respects it greatly. If a Daoist from Azure Cloud Temple comes forward to testify, Consort Zheng's conspiracy will collapse on its own."

He paused, somewhat worried, "But Azure Cloud Temple is far away in the Zhongnan Mountains, and the journey is long. You've just recovered; a long journey might harm your health. Moreover, there might be obstacles from Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect along the way."

"I'm fine."

Zhu Changlan said with a smile, "My injury has already healed, and my cultivation has mostly recovered. Ordinary demons and assassins can't harm me. Moreover, with the dagger and jade pendant you gave me, I'm even more confident."

He paused, continuing, "As for obstacles, it's just an opportunity to see what methods Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect have."

The Crown Prince looked into his determined eyes and nodded: "Very well, I approve. I will send the Hidden Guard of the Brocade Guard to protect you, and prepare enough travel funds and tokens. If you encounter trouble, you can contact the local government using the tokens."

"Thank you, Elder Brother."

The Crown Prince helped him up, patting him on the shoulder: "Be careful on the road and return early. I'll wait for you in the Eastern Palace. When you come back, we'll deal with Consort Zheng together."

## I. Departure: Hidden Guards Accompany, Killing Intent Lurks

On the day of Zhu Changlan's departure, the sky was just beginning to brighten. The carriage from the Eastern Palace was already prepared, its body painted in a low-key dark brown, with soft brocade lining the interior. Inside were clothes, medicine, and travel funds prepared by the Crown Prince for him. Little Salary cried like a tearful person, pulling on Zhu Changlan's sleeve, reluctant to let go: "Your Highness, please take care of yourself, remember to take your medicine on time, don't push yourself if you encounter anything, and come back early."

Zhu Changlan smiled and patted his shoulder: "Don't worry, I will. Stay well in Tranquility Palace, and I'll bring you special products from Azure Cloud Temple when I return."

The Crown Prince personally saw him to the palace gate, handing him a brocade box: "Inside is the dragon-patterned jade pendant Father gave me. With this jade pendant, you can mobilize military forces along the way. It might be useful if you encounter danger."

He paused, then handed him a small porcelain bottle, "This is an antidote specially made by Imperial Physician Li. The demons of the Black Bone Sect are skilled in using poison. Take it with you just in case."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade box and porcelain bottle, carefully storing them: "Elder Brother, after I leave, you must be careful. Consort Zheng and the Third Prince will definitely take advantage of my absence to make trouble for you."

"I know."

The Crown Prince nodded, his eyes firm, "Don't worry, I'll be on guard. When you return, we'll settle old scores together."

Zhu Changlan boarded the carriage, lifted the curtain, and waved to the Crown Prince: "Elder Brother, take care."

The Crown Prince also waved, watching the carriage slowly leave the palace gate until it disappeared at the end of the palace road before turning back to the Eastern Palace. He knew this journey would not be peaceful.

The carriage exited the capital and traveled west along the official road. Zhu Changlan sat in the carriage, closing his eyes to rest and circulating demonic energy to sense the surrounding aura. He could feel two forces following him secretly: one was assassins sent by Consort Zheng, and the other carried a strong black aura---demons from the Black Bone Sect.

"Your Highness, there's a tail behind us." The voice of the leader of the Hidden Guard came from outside the carriage, his tone serious.

"I know."

Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, a cold glint flashing in his eyes, "Don't bother with them first, let's see what they're up to."

The carriage continued forward. When it reached a desolate valley, the assassins and demons following behind finally couldn't hold back. More than a dozen black-clad assassins rushed out from the dense forest on both sides of the valley, holding sharp blades, directly pouncing on the carriage. At the same time, three demons from the Black Bone Sect appeared, their bodies wrapped in black gas, their faces hideous, emitting ear-piercing roars.

"Your Highness, be careful!" The leader of the Hidden Guard shouted, leading more than a dozen Hidden Guards to meet them.

Zhu Changlan lifted the carriage curtain, looked at the battle in front of him, and a cold smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. He tightened his grip on the golden nanmu dagger at his waist, the cat's eye stone glowing blue in the sunlight. He moved like a shadow, rushing out of the carriage, the dagger carrying golden demonic energy, directly pouncing on one of the demons.

The demon didn't expect Zhu Changlan to be so fast and couldn't react in time. The dagger pierced its chest. Green blood flowed from the wound, carrying a foul stench. The demon let out a scream, its body gradually turning into black gas and dissipating into the air.

The other two demons, seeing this, roared and pounced on Zhu Changlan at the same time. Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, shuttling between the demons like a cat, his dagger wielded airtight, golden demonic energy colliding with black gas, emitting ear-piercing sounds. The Hidden Guards also fought hard, engaging in a fierce battle with the black-clad assassins, with swords clashing and blood splattering.

Zhu Changlan entangled with the two demons for dozens of rounds, gradually figuring out their moves. He seized the opportunity, circulated his demonic energy, maximizing the blue glow of the cat's eye stone. The dagger, with a blinding light, pierced the eyebrow of one of the demons. The other demon, seeing its companion killed, was terrified and turned to run.

"Want to run?" 

Zhu Changlan sneered, throwing the dagger with a flick of his wrist. The dagger accurately pierced the demon's heart. The demon fell to the ground, turning into black gas and dissipating.

After dealing with the demons, Zhu Changlan turned to look at the black-clad assassins. By this time, the Hidden Guards had already dealt with most of the assassins. The remaining few assassins, seeing the demons killed, were吓得 pale and tried to run. Zhu Changlan moved like a flash, catching up to one of the assassins, the dagger resting on his neck: "Who sent you?"

The assassin trembled all over, his voice shaking: "It's... it's Consort Zheng..."

"As expected."

A cold glint flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes. He exerted a little force, and the assassin fell to the ground. The remaining assassins were also dealt with one by one by the Hidden Guards.

After cleaning up the scene, the leader of the Hidden Guards approached Zhu Changlan: "Your Highness, everything is taken care of."

"Hmm." Zhu Changlan nodded, retracting his dagger, "Continue on, be careful."

The carriage continued forward. Zhu Changlan knew this was just the beginning, and there would be more dangers ahead. But he had no fear. He must reach Azure Cloud Temple as soon as possible and gain its support to protect himself and the Crown Prince.

## II. Azure Cloud Temple: Reunion with an Old Friend, Revealing the Heavenly Secret

After five days of long journey, Zhu Changlan finally arrived at the Zhongnan Mountains. The Zhongnan Mountains stretched endlessly, shrouded in clouds and mist, like an ink painting. Azure Cloud Temple was located halfway up the mountain, with gray bricks and tiles, ancient and elegant, exuding an immortal aura.

Zhu Changlan got out of the carriage, leaving the Hidden Guards to wait at the foot of the mountain, while he walked alone towards Azure Cloud Temple. At the temple gate, two young Taoist boys stopped him: "Benefactor, what brings you to Azure Cloud Temple?"

Zhu Changlan bowed: "Greetings, Taoist boys. I've come to visit the Abbot Xuan Qing of Azure Cloud Temple. Please inform him of my arrival."

He took out the black jade given to him by the Taoist priest back then, handing it to the Taoist boy, "This is a keepsake given to me by Abbot Xuan Qing."

The Taoist boy took the black jade, examined it carefully, and his face changed. He quickly bowed: "So you're an old friend of Abbot Xuan Qing. Please follow me, Benefactor."

Zhu Changlan followed the Taoist boy into Azure Cloud Temple. Inside, ancient trees towered into the sky, and incense smoke filled the air, with many pilgrims praying devoutly. The Taoist boy led him through the front hall to outside the meditation room in the back hall, saying softly: "Benefactor, Abbot Xuan Qing is meditating inside. Please wait a moment."

Zhu Changlan nodded and stood outside the meditation room. After a while, the door of the meditation room slowly opened, and a Taoist priest in white walked out. His hair and beard were all white, but his eyes were extremely clear, with a faint golden light surrounding his body---it was Taoist Priest Xuan Qing, who had saved Zhu Changlan back then.

"Meta Jade, you're here." Taoist Priest Xuan Qing said with a smile, his tone gentle.

Zhu Changlan bowed, his eyes slightly red: "Taoist Priest, long time no see."

"Come in."

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing stepped aside to let him enter. The meditation room was simply furnished, with only a meditation bed, a desk, and a few chairs. On the desk was a teapot, emitting a faint heat.

They sat down, and Taoist Priest Xuan Qing poured him a cup of tea: "How have you been all these years?"

Zhu Changlan picked up the cup, took a sip. The bitter-sweet taste reminded him of his days in the snow. He sighed and told Taoist Priest Xuan Qing about his experiences over the years, from the destruction of the Spirit Valley, wandering in the mortal world, to reincarnating as the Ninth Prince, the palace banquet assassination, and Consort Zheng's persecution, recounting everything in detail.

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing listened quietly, his face calm. After Zhu Changlan finished, he slowly said: "Your current situation is also predestined. Snow Spirit Cats are born with nine lives and deep blessings. Only by going through hardships can you achieve enlightenment."

"Taoist Priest, I've come this time to ask for your help."

Zhu Changlan said, "Consort Zheng suspects my identity and sent the imperial physician to investigate. If I hadn't deliberately disguised myself, I would have already been exposed. I want to ask you to help me prove that I'm not an evil spirit, so that Consort Zheng has no reason to make trouble."

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing nodded: "This is not difficult. You are not an evil spirit but a beloved creature of heaven and earth. I will naturally help you."

He paused, continuing, "Moreover, the Black Bone Sect has been doing evil for many years, harming living beings. Azure Cloud Temple has long wanted to eliminate them. Now that the Black Bone Sect is colluding with Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, plotting evil schemes, this is just the right opportunity to join forces to deal with them."

Zhu Changlan was overjoyed: "Thank you, Taoist Priest."

"You don't need to thank me."

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing said, "Protecting the righteous path in the mortal world is the responsibility of Azure Cloud Temple. Moreover, we are destined, so I won't stand by and watch."

He took out a talisman from his sleeve and handed it to Zhu Changlan, "This is a 'Purification Talisman' that can prove your identity and dispel evil spirits. Take it with you. If anyone questions your identity again, just show this talisman, and it will prove your innocence."

Zhu Changlan took the talisman. A faint golden light surrounded the talisman, carrying a pure spiritual energy. He quickly bowed in thanks: "Thank you, Taoist Priest."

"Additionally, I will send several disciples to accompany you back to the capital."

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing said, "They will assist you in dealing with the demons of the Black Bone Sect and protect your safety."

"Thank you for your thoughtful arrangement, Taoist Priest." Zhu Changlan said gratefully.

They chatted for a while longer. Taoist Priest Xuan Qing explained some cultivation insights to him and taught him a new defensive technique that could better exert demonic energy to deal with the demons of the Black Bone Sect. Zhu Changlan listened carefully, committing every word the Taoist Priest said to memory.

When leaving Azure Cloud Temple, Taoist Priest Xuan Qing sent four disciples to accompany him---all elites of Azure Cloud Temple, with high cultivation and skilled in subduing demons and eliminating evil. Zhu Changlan set off back to the capital with the four Taoist disciples.

## III. Return Journey: Joining Forces to Defeat Enemies, Fame Beginning to Spread

The journey back to the capital was even more dangerous than the journey there. Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect, upon learning that Zhu Changlan had gone to Azure Cloud Temple, sent more assassins and demons to intercept him halfway.

When they reached a place called "Black Wind Ridge," they were attacked by a large number of Black Bone Sect demons. These demons were more powerful than those encountered before, their bodies filled with thick black gas, attacking ruthlessly and using evil techniques.

"Everyone be careful!"

Zhu Changlan shouted, gripping his dagger tightly, and took the lead in rushing forward. The four Azure Cloud Temple disciples also immediately displayed their spells. Golden talismans flew through the air, colliding with the demons' black gas, emitting dazzling light.

The demons let out ear-piercing roars and rushed forward one after another. Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, his dagger carrying golden demonic energy and the blue glow of the cat's eye stone. Every swing of the dagger pierced the vital point of a demon.

The Azure Cloud Temple disciples formed a formation, their talismans raining down like a storm, continuously attacking the demons and purifying the black gas in the air.

The battle lasted for a full hour, with demon corpses lying on the ground and green blood staining the earth. Zhu Changlan and the four disciples also consumed a lot of spiritual energy, with more or less injuries on their bodies.

"Finally dealt with them." One of the disciples said, panting.

Zhu Changlan nodded, looking at the corpses on the ground, a cold glint flashing in his eyes: "The demons of the Black Bone Sect are really difficult to deal with."

He took out the antidote given by the Crown Prince and distributed it to the four disciples, "This is an antidote. Take it just in case."

The four disciples thanked him and took the medicine. The black gas in their bodies gradually dissipated, and their spirits perked up.

After resting for a moment, they continued their journey. Along the way, they encountered several more attacks, including assassins sent by Consort Zheng and demons from the Black Bone Sect, but they all defeated them with the joint efforts of Zhu Changlan and the Azure Cloud Temple disciples. Zhu Changlan's reputation gradually spread along the way. Many common people knew that there was a "Ninth Prince" who, along with Taoist priests from Azure Cloud Temple, subdued demons and eliminated evil along the way, protecting the peace of one side.

When they arrived back in the capital, the news had already spread throughout the streets. The common people flocked to the streets, wanting to see Zhu Changlan's demeanor. Consort Zheng, upon learning that Zhu Changlan had not only returned safely but also brought disciples from Azure Cloud Temple and gained fame, was so angry her face turned blue, but she was helpless.

Zhu Changlan returned to the Eastern Palace. The Crown Prince had already been waiting at the palace gate. Seeing him return safely, a relieved smile appeared on his face: "Ninth Brother, you're back."

"Elder Brother." Zhu Changlan bowed, "I've made you worry."

The Crown Prince helped him up, looking at the four Azure Cloud Temple disciples behind him, and said with a smile: "These must be the disciples sent by Abbot Xuan Qing, right? Thank you for your hard work一路上."

The four disciples bowed: "Greetings, Crown Prince."

"Please come in."

The Crown Prince led them into the Eastern Palace and held a banquet to entertain them. During the banquet, the Crown Prince discussed with Zhu Changlan and the four disciples strategies to deal with Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect, and the atmosphere was warm.

## IV. Court: Daoist Testifies, Consort Zheng Loses Power

Three days later, the Emperor held a court meeting in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. As expected, Consort Zheng launched an attack, impeaching Zhu Changlan for being "a demon bewitching the royal family" and having Imperial Physician Li come forward to testify.

Imperial Physician Li bowed: "Your Majesty, Ninth Prince's pulse is indeed abnormal, carrying the spiritual energy of a demon. I dare not deceive Your Majesty."

Consort Zheng quickly echoed: "Your Majesty, Ninth Prince's origins are unknown and he possesses demonic powers. If he stays in the palace, he will definitely cause chaos. Please Your Majesty depose him, imprison him in the sky prison, and uphold the law."

The Third Prince Zhu Changxun also followed suit: "Father, what Mother says is extremely true. Ninth Brother's origins are unknown and his behavior is strange. I suspect he is a spy sent by the Black Bone Sect, intending to overthrow our Great Ming dynasty."

The Emperor frowned, looking at Zhu Changlan: "Ninth Brother, is this true?"

Zhu Changlan bowed: "Father, your son is not a demon. What Consort Zheng and Third Brother said are all slander."

He took out the Purification Talisman given by Taoist Priest Xuan Qing from his sleeve, "This is a Purification Talisman given by Abbot Xuan Qing of Azure Cloud Temple, which can prove my identity. Abbot Xuan Qing is the leader of the righteous path in the mortal world, with high virtue and prestige. Your Majesty should believe his words, right?"

With that, he handed the Purification Talisman to the Emperor. When the Emperor took the talisman, he felt a pure spiritual energy扑面而来, and his doubts immediately dissipated a lot.

At this moment, a report came from outside the hall: "Your Majesty, Abbot Xuan Qing of Azure Cloud Temple requests an audience."

The Emperor's heart moved, and he quickly said: "Quickly invite him in."

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing, dressed in white, walked slowly into the Hall of Supreme Harmony and bowed: "Greetings, Your Majesty."

The Emperor quickly said: "Please rise, Taoist Priest."

"I have come today to testify for Ninth Prince."

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing said, "Ninth Prince is a Snow Spirit Cat from the foot of Kunlun Mountain, born with nine lives and deep blessings, not an evil spirit. He reincarnated as the Ninth Prince by fate, and has always been kind-hearted, secretly protecting the people and the royal family."

He paused, continuing, "On the contrary, Consort Zheng and the Third Prince are colluding with the Black Bone Sect, plotting to assassinate the Crown Prince and usurp the throne. Here is the evidence."

With that, he took out a stack of letters from his sleeve and handed them to the Emperor. These letters were secretly collected by the Azure Cloud Temple disciples, detailing the evidence of Consort Zheng, the Third Prince, and the Black Bone Sect colluding, including plans to assassinate the Crown Prince and instructions to mobilize Black Bone Sect demons.

After reading the letters, the Emperor's face turned livid, and he slammed the table: "What a vicious woman! What an unfilial son! How dare you collude with demons and plot evil schemes!"

Consort Zheng and the Third Prince turned pale, quickly kneeling: "Your Majesty, this is all slander!"

"Slander?"

Taoist Priest Xuan Qing sneered, "The evidence is conclusive. How dare you argue? The demons of the Black Bone Sect have already confessed everything."

The Emperor was furious: "Guards, imprison Consort Zheng and the Third Prince in the sky prison for strict interrogation!"

The guards stepped forward and dragged Consort Zheng and the Third Prince away. The two cried out in冤枉, but no one paid attention.

After the court meeting, the Emperor looked at Zhu Changlan, his eyes gentle: "Ninth Brother, you have suffered. If it weren't for the Taoist Priest testifying, I would have almost been deceived by the traitors."

"Father, your son has not suffered."

Zhu Changlan bowed, "As long as I can clear my name, eliminate the traitors, and protect our Great Ming dynasty, your son is willing to do anything."

The Emperor nodded, growing fonder of Zhu Changlan: "Good, good, you truly are my good son. From now on, you are my most trusted prince. The position of Crown Prince belongs to your Elder Brother, and no one can shake it."

Zhu Changlan and the Crown Prince quickly bowed: "Thank you, Father."

## V. Epilogue: Dust Settles, Warmth Remains

After Consort Zheng and the Third Prince were imprisoned in the sky prison, they soon confessed to all their crimes. The Emperor was furious, issuing an edict to depose Consort Zheng's rank, demote the Third Prince to a commoner, and exile him to the border. The demons of the Black Bone Sect were also eliminated by the joint efforts of the Azure Cloud Temple disciples and the Crown Prince's Hidden Guard, and the capital returned to its former peace.

Zhu Changlan was awarded the title of "Protecting Country Prince" for his meritorious service in protecting the country, and was rewarded with countless treasures. Tranquility Palace was also expanded, second only in scale to the Eastern Palace. After expansion, Tranquility Palace's layout became more exquisite: the main hall still hung the plaque "Ci An" (慈安, Compassionate Peace), and several side rooms were added outside the east and west auxiliary halls, serving as a study, alchemy room, and library; the courtyard was also doubled in size, with several plum trees and bamboo plants newly planted, complementing the original osmanthus trees and magnolia trees, providing beautiful scenery in all four seasons. However, he still preferred to live a leisurely life, reading, admiring flowers, brewing osmanthus wine in Tranquility Palace every day, occasionally visiting the Eastern Palace to meet the Crown Prince, or discussing cultivation with the disciples of Azure Cloud Temple. In spring, he would play the qin under the magnolia tree; in summer, he would enjoy the cool air by the ancient well, chilling watermelon with well water; in autumn, he would pick osmanthus flowers to brew wine; in winter, he would boil tea under the plum tree, admiring the snow and listening to the qin.

On this day, Zhu Changlan was sunbathing in the courtyard of Tranquility Palace. Little Salary came over with a cup of tea: "Your Highness, the Crown Prince has sent a message inviting you to a feast at the Eastern Palace tonight."

Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, smiling: "Okay, I know."

He got up, changed into comfortable brocade clothes, and walked towards the Eastern Palace. The setting sun cast its golden light on the palace road, stretching his shadow long. Looking at the distant Eastern Palace, a gentle smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

After so many storms, he had finally protected the people he cared about and preserved this hard-won brotherly affection. From now on, no one could harm him and the Crown Prince, and no one could destroy the warmth in this deep palace.

In the courtyard of the Eastern Palace, the Crown Prince had already been waiting. The table was filled with sumptuous dishes and Zhu Changlan's favorite osmanthus wine. Seeing Zhu Changlan approaching, the Crown Prince smiled and stepped forward: "Ninth Brother, you're here."

"Elder Brother." Zhu Changlan smiled in response.

They sat down, and the Crown Prince poured him a cup of osmanthus wine: "Come, let's drink to our brotherhood and to this peaceful era."

Zhu Changlan raised his cup, clinking it with the Crown Prince's, and took a sip. The sweet taste of osmanthus wine filled his mouth, like a warm current flowing through his heart. He looked at the Crown Prince's gentle smile, listened to the sound of insects in the courtyard, and felt unprecedented peace in his heart.

He knew that the most precious things in this world are not immortality cultivation or supreme power, but family, sincere friendship, and the warmth preserved through storms. From now on, he would cherish this hard-won happiness, protecting the Great Ming dynasty with the Crown Prince, and guarding this warmth forever.
