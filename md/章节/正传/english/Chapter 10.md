Chapter 10: The Emperor's Indifference, the Royal Family's Alienation

Year 25 of the Wanli Reign, late early summer.

On the tenth day of Zhu Changlan's group's deep penetration into the Ten Thousand Mountains in the southern border to track the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, the morning light of the imperial palace in the capital still followed old customs,穿透ing layers of palace walls and branches, casting细碎 light spots on the white marble steps in front of Qianqing Palace. But although this morning light was warm, it seemed unable to pierce the heavy twilight笼罩ing the imperial palace, let alone warm the alienation and indifference flowing in the royal blood.

Inside Qianqing Palace, top-quality sandalwood burned in the incense burner, smoke curling upward,缠绕ing the silent monarch and ministers. Emperor Zhu Yijun of the Wanli Reign sat high on the dragon throne, his bright yellow dragon robe making his face even more majestic. But in those deep eyes, there was no warmth at all, only weighing and scrutiny. He held a report sent back from the southern border by a fast horse, his fingertips caressing the yellowed paper, silent for a long time.

Kneeling below was the Jinyiwei dark guard commander responsible for传递ing news from the southern border. His head was lowered, fine sweat beads on his forehead, his breath extremely light. Since Zhu Changlan left the capital, he had sent back investigation progress every three days, but every time he faced the emperor, he felt the emperor's piercing indifference, which was more suffocating than the southern border's miasma.

"That is to say, the Ninth Prince has already slaughtered the demons at two Black Bone Sect strongholds in Black Wind Forest and Black Wind Valley, and is now investigating deep into the Demon Cave?" After a long time, Zhu Yijun finally spoke slowly, his voice flat, without the slightest concern, as if asking about an unimportant political matter.

"Returning to Your Majesty, that's exactly it." The Jinyiwei dark guard commander replied respectfully, "With the fish dried bait strategy, Ninth Prince has successively destroyed two Black Bone Sect strongholds, slaughtering many core demons including a thousand-year poison pincer centipede, a five-hundred-year lion-headed demon, etc. He has now broken through the first defense line of the Demon Cave, slaughtered a thousand-year scaled lizard demon, and is investigating deep into the cave to track the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul. Daoist Xuanchen and twenty elite Jinyiwei dark guards have always been responding from the periphery, and their lives are not in danger for now."

Zhu Yijun "hm"ed, no longer asking more, casually throwing the report on the dragon case beside him. The report fell among a mountain of memorials, making a slight sound, but like a stone sinking into the sea, not stirring any emotional waves in him. The hall fell into silence again, the sandalwood scent becoming more intense, but making people feel chest tightness and shortness of breath.

Prime Minister Zhang standing on the side of the hall sighed secretly. He had followed Zhu Yijun for many years, deeply understanding this emperor's temperament. The emperor's heart is unfathomable and cold as ice. Especially to his princes, Zhu Yijun had never had the warmth of an ordinary father, only using and balancing in his eyes. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was gentle and benevolent, but had never gained the emperor's full trust; Third Prince Zhu Changxun was ambitious, previously colluding with Consort Zheng in an attempted rebellion, and was deposed and confined; while Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, weak since childhood and with demon power, had never entered Zhu Yijun's eyes. If it weren't for the fact that the Black Bone Sect matter was related to the spiritual vein source and the dynasty's foundation, Zhu Yijun would never have agreed to let him go to the southern border personally.

"Your Majesty," Prime Minister Zhang stepped forward, clasping his hands, "Ninth Prince has gone deep into danger, tracking demons, dedicating himself to the dynasty's safety. Now he has broken through the Demon Cave defense line, only a step away from the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul. I believe we should immediately dispatch southern border garrisons to reinforce him, ensuring everything is safe."

Zhu Yijun looked at Prime Minister Zhang, his eyes indifferent: "Reinforce? No need."

Prime Minister Zhang was stunned, then quickly said: "Your Majesty, the Demon Cave is extremely dangerous,盘踞ed by countless thousand-year demons. Ninth Prince, relying only on himself and Daoist Xuanchen and others,恐难应对. If anything happens, not only will the previous efforts be wasted, but we will also lose a prince, which is disgraceful for the dynasty."

"Disgrace?" A cold curve appeared at the corner of Zhu Yijun's mouth, "My prince, if he can't even handle this danger, he's not worth dying for." He paused, his tone even more indifferent, "Moreover, the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul is injured, and Zhu Changlan has his Snow Spirit Cat true form, plus Daoist Xuanchen's assistance, he may not have no chance of winning. Let him go through it, let's see how capable he is, whether he's worth me mobilizing troops for."

These words made everyone in the hall shiver. The Jinyiwei dark guard commander's body trembled slightly. He remembered Zhu Changlan's appearance of fighting bloody battles in the southern border, remembered the Jinyiwei dark guard bodies torn apart by demons, and then compared it with the emperor's current indifference, a unspeakable sadness welled up in his heart. Prime Minister Zhang also frowned, wanting to persuade more, but was stopped by Zhu Yijun's cold eyes.

"I have decided on this matter, no need to discuss it further." Zhu Yijun said in a deep voice, "Transmit my decree: the southern border garrisons stay in place,不得擅自调动. As for Ninth Prince, let him investigate on his own. If he can successfully eliminate the remnant soul, it will be a great achievement; if he fails, he can only blame his own incompetence."

"Your Majesty......" Prime Minister Zhang wanted to speak, but saw Zhu Yijun wave his hand, signaling him to retreat. Helpless, Prime Minister Zhang could only bow and exit Qianqing Palace with the Jinyiwei dark guard commander.

The moment the hall door closed, the majesty on Zhu Yijun's face gradually faded, leaving only deep exhaustion and complexity. He walked to the dragon case, picked up the discarded report, his fingertips brushing over the three words "Zhu Changlan", his eyes dark and unclear. In fact, he didn't completely not care about this son, but in the royal family, warmth has always been the most luxury. He is an emperor, first considering the dynasty's stability and continuation, rather than father-son affection. Zhu Changlan has demon power, which is an alien in the royal family. If he can't prove his value, he will sooner or later become a hidden danger to the dynasty. Letting him go to the southern border this time is not only to eliminate the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, but also a test for him. It's just that this test is cruel to the point of being ruthless.

Zhu Yijun put down the report, his gaze looking out the window. In the courtyard of Qianqing Palace, several ancient cypresses were lush and leafy, sunlight filtering through the branches, forming斑驳 shadows on the ground. He remembered Zhu Changlan's childhood appearance, a small body, thin and weak, every time he saw him, he would hide timidly behind the wet nurse, not daring to approach. At that time, he also had a moment of emotion, but this emotion was soon drowned by the emperor's responsibility and suspicion. Now Zhu Changlan has grown up, with his own ability and responsibility, but the distance between them is getting farther and farther.

At the same time, in the Eastern Palace, Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was anxiously waiting for news from the southern border. He paced back and forth in the study, holding a jade pendant in his hand, which was what he and Zhu Changlan asked for together as children, symbolizing brotherhood. Since Zhu Changlan left the capital, he has been unable to eat or sleep, worrying day and night. Although the news Zhu Changlan sent back every time was relatively smooth, he knew better than anyone how dangerous the Ten Thousand Mountains in the southern border were.

"Your Highness, the Jinyiwei dark guard commander has returned from Qianqing Palace." The eunuch reported softly.

Zhu Changluo's eyes lit up, quickly saying: "Let him in!"

The Jinyiwei dark guard commander walked into the study, bowing and saluting: "Greetings to Crown Prince."

"How is Ninth Brother doing? Did Father issue any decrees?" Zhu Changluo asked quickly, his tone full of concern.

The Jinyiwei dark guard commander reported to Zhu Changluo in detail the situation in Qianqing Palace, including Zhu Changlan's investigation progress, and the emperor's decision to refuse to send reinforcements.

After listening to the report, Zhu Changluo's face instantly darkened, the jade pendant in his hand was捏得 tightly, his knuckles turning white. "How can Father be so indifferent!" He couldn't help but低吼, "Ninth Brother has gone deep into the Demon Cave, in extreme danger, but Father not only refuses to send reinforcements, but also says 'not worth dying for'. Is this father-son affection?"

The Jinyiwei dark guard commander lowered his head, not daring to answer. The Crown Prince and Ninth Prince have a deep brotherly bond, and he understands the Crown Prince's anger now, but the emperor's decree, they can't disobey.

Zhu Changluo took a deep breath, trying to calm his emotions. Anger is useless, the most urgent thing is to find a way to support Zhu Changlan. "Jinyiwei dark guard commander, you immediately take people to the southern border, give this military token to Ninth Brother." Zhu Changluo took out a military token from his arms, handing it to the Jinyiwei dark guard commander, "This is the military token I secretly mobilize Eastern Palace guards with. Although the troops are not many, they can always help Ninth Brother a bit. Tell Ninth Brother to take care of himself, if things can't be done, immediately withdraw, don't force yourself."

The Jinyiwei dark guard commander took the military token, bowing: "This subordinate takes orders! Your Highness rest assured, this subordinate will definitely deliver the military token to Ninth Prince safely."

After the Jinyiwei dark guard commander left, Zhu Changluo sat alone in the study, his eyes full of exhaustion and helplessness. As Crown Prince, he seems noble and incomparable, but he can't even protect his own brother. Father's indifference, the royal family's alienation, like an invisible net, tightly wrapping him, making him breathless. He remembered his childhood, he played with Zhu Changlan and Zhu Changxun in the Imperial Garden. At that time, although they also had disputes, they also had simple happiness. But as they grew older, royal struggles, father's suspicion, made this brotherly bond gradually deteriorate. Zhu Changxun was ambitious, eventually taking the path of rebellion; while he and Zhu Changlan, although still deeply attached, had to always be on guard against the hidden arrows around them.

"Your Highness, Consort Zheng sent someone." The eunuch reported again.

Zhu Changluo frowned, a trace of disgust rising in his heart. The current Consort Zheng is newly canonized, from a famous family, but has a narrow mind, determined to let her own son take the Crown Prince's position. Since Zhu Changlan left the capital, she has repeatedly said bad things about Zhu Changlan in front of Father, trying to alienate them.

"Let her in." Zhu Changluo said in a deep voice.

Consort Zheng's personal maid walked into the study, bowing and saluting: "Greetings to Crown Prince. Upon hearing that Ninth Prince is progressing smoothly in the southern border, Consort Zheng specially sent some supplements to nourish Your Highness's body." With that, she placed an exquisite food box on the table.

Zhu Changluo glanced at the food box, his tone cold: "Thank Consort Zheng for me. Leave the supplements, you can go back."

The maid answered, but didn't leave immediately, hesitating to say: "Your Highness, Consort Zheng also asked this servant to tell you that Ninth Prince has demon power, this time going deep into the Demon Cave,恐会被妖气侵蚀, his nature changing. Now many ministers in the court have submitted memorials, requesting His Majesty to restrict Ninth Prince's power, to prevent unexpected events. Consort Zheng hopes that Your Highness can prioritize the dynasty's overall situation, persuade His Majesty to recall Ninth Prince to the capital as soon as possible."

"Impudent!" Zhu Changluo slammed the table, angrily shouting, "Ninth Brother is risking his life in danger for the dynasty's safety, but Consort Zheng not only doesn't appreciate his contributions, but also sows discord here. What is her intention?"

The maid was so scared that she trembled all over, quickly kneeling on the ground: "Your Highness, please calm down. This servant is only passing the message, not daring to say a single false word."

"Get out!" Zhu Changluo said coldly.

The maid was granted amnesty, quickly getting up and running out of the study in embarrassment.

Looking at the maid's departing figure, Zhu Changluo's face became even more难看. Consort Zheng's words were not groundless. Many ministers in the court are indeed忌惮 of Zhu Changlan's demon power. Now that Zhu Changlan has made military achievements in the southern border, his power is growing, these people are even more restless. And Father's indifference just gives these people an opportunity.

He walked to the window, looking deep into the imperial palace. There is the center of power, but also a cold cage. In the royal family, there is no forever family affection, only eternal interests. He doesn't know where this conspiracy against Zhu Changlan will go; he also doesn't know if his brotherly bond with Zhu Changlan can withstand the royal family's indifference and alienation.

At the same time, the former Consort Zheng and deposed Crown Prince Zhu Changxun, who were confined in the cold palace, also got news of Zhu Changlan in the southern border.

Inside the cold palace, the environment is simple, damp musty smell everywhere. Former Consort Zheng wore a plain prison uniform, her hair messy, no longer having the elegance of the past. She sat on the cold stone bed, listening to the news from her trusted maid, a trace of venomous light flashing in her eyes.

"That little bastard Zhu Changlan has such good luck!" Former Consort Zheng gritted her teeth, "I didn't expect that with his demon power, he not only wasn't executed, but also made military achievements. If he comes back safely, there will be no hope for our mother and son."

Deposed Crown Prince Zhu Changxun sat beside her, his face gloomy. Since he was deposed, he has been confined in the cold palace, his former ambition and pride already worn away, leaving only endless resentment. "Mother, don't worry, Zhu Changlan will never end well." Zhu Changxun's voice was hoarse and cold, "The Demon Cave is extremely dangerous, even if he can narrowly escape the demons' attacks, he can't escape the ministers' schemes. Moreover, Father has always been suspicious of him. As long as we add fuel to the fire, we can definitely make him disgraced, die without a burial place."

Former Consort Zheng nodded, a trace of hope flashing in her eyes: "Ze'er, what's your plan?"

Zhu Changxun leaned close to former Consort Zheng, whispering: "Mother, we can secretly contact ministers in the court who are dissatisfied with Zhu Changlan, let them submit memorials to His Majesty, falsely accusing Zhu Changlan of colluding with the Black Bone Sect, using demon power to commit evil. Then spread rumors that Zhu Changlan has been eroded by demon qi, his nature changing, intending to rebel. Father is suspicious by nature, as long as we do it seamlessly, we can definitely make Father believe our words, order Zhu Changlan to be executed."

A fierce light flashed in former Consort Zheng's eyes: "Good! Let's do it according to what you said. No matter what price we pay, we must get rid of Zhu Changlan! As long as Zhu Changlan dies, there is still hope for the Crown Prince position, and our mother and son can see the light of day again!"

The mother and son looked at each other, their eyes full of venom and scheming. They didn't know that their conspiracy would not only bring a fatal crisis to Zhu Changlan, but also drag the entire royal family into a deeper abyss.

A few days later, a storm against Zhu Changlan果然 arose in the court. Many ministers jointly submitted memorials, falsely accusing Zhu Changlan of colluding with the Black Bone Sect, using demon power to harm living beings, intending to rebel. At the same time, various rumors about Zhu Changlan spread in the capital, saying that he was eroded by the Demon Cave's demon qi, becoming a bloodthirsty monster.

In Qianqing Palace, Zhu Yijun looked at the mountain of memorials, his face as dark as water. Most of these memorials and rumors were untrue, but the suspicion in his heart grew like weeds. Zhu Changlan has demon power, which has always been a thorn in his heart. Now with so many ministers submitting memorials, he has to re-examine Zhu Changlan.

"Your Majesty," Prime Minister Zhang admonished again, "These memorials and rumors are obviously someone deliberately doing it, intending to frame Ninth Prince. Ninth Prince risked his life in the southern border, eliminating demons for the dynasty, making great achievements, how can he be slandered by these untrue words? I implore Your Majesty to明察秋毫, return Ninth Prince's innocence."

"明察秋毫?" Zhu Yijun said coldly, "Prime Minister Zhang, how do you know these are all untrue? Zhu Changlan has demon power, inherently different from ordinary people. Who can guarantee that he hasn't been eroded by demon qi, hasn't had evil intentions?"

Prime Minister Zhang wanted to persuade more, but saw Zhu Yijun wave his hand: "Okay, I have my own decision. Transmit my decree: suspend all Ninth Prince's powers, order him to immediately return to the capital, accept investigation. If he dares to disobey the order, he will be charged with rebellion."

"Your Majesty! Absolutely not!" Prime Minister Zhang said urgently, "Ninth Prince is now investigating the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul in the Demon Cave. If he is recalled at this time, not only will all previous efforts be wasted, but he will also be in danger. If the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul learns of this, he will definitely take the opportunity to counterattack, and the consequences will be unimaginable!"

"Consequences?" Zhu Yijun's eyes were cold, "I only know that if Zhu Changlan continues to stay in the southern border, allowing his power to grow, the consequences will be more serious. As for the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, he is just a homeless dog. Even if he counterattacks, he can't make any big waves."

Looking at Zhu Yijun's cold face, Prime Minister Zhang felt a deep sense of powerlessness. Once the emperor makes a decision, it is difficult to change. This conspiracy against Zhu Changlan has successfully shaken the emperor's trust in Zhu Changlan.

The decree was soon sent to the southern border. At this time, Zhu Changlan had just gone deep into the Demon Cave's hinterland, finding the secret room where the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul was hiding. He was about to launch an attack when he received the emperor's decree.

"Your Highness, His Majesty orders you to immediately return to the capital, accept investigation, and has suspended all your powers." The Jinyiwei dark guard commander held the decree, his tone heavy.

Zhu Changlan was stunned. He took the decree, read it carefully, a trace of disbelief and deep disappointment flashing in his eyes. He fought bloody battles in the southern border, risking his life, just to eliminate the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, protect the dynasty's safety. But in the end, what he got was Father's suspicion and distrust, a cold decree and investigation.

"Hahaha......" Zhu Changlan suddenly laughed, his laughter full of sadness and mockery, "Father's indifference, the royal family's alienation, I finally see it today. My Zhu Changlan's life, has nothing to be ashamed of the dynasty, nothing to be ashamed of Father. But in the end, I get the charge of colluding with the enemy and rebelling."

Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, comforting him: "Your Highness, His Majesty must have been蒙蔽 by villains. You must not be impulsive, go back to the capital first, explain to His Majesty clearly, everything will come to light."

Zhu Changlan shook his head, his eyes firm: "Explain? Since His Majesty has issued the decree, it means he no longer trusts me. Even if I go back to the capital, I may not be able to explain clearly. Moreover, the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul is right in front of me, how can I give up the opportunity to eliminate him because of this decree? If I let him escape, he will definitely make a comeback in the future, causing even greater harm."

"But Your Highness, disobeying the decree is rebellion!" The Jinyiwei dark guard commander said urgently.

"Rebellion?" Zhu Changlan's eyes were cold, "My Zhu Changlan has dedicated his life to the country, what fear do I have of the name of rebellion? Today, even if I disobey the decree, I will completely eliminate the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul!"

With that, Zhu Changlan gripped the wooden sword tightly, his demon power surging all over his body, rushing towards the depths of the secret room. Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards saw this, no longer hesitating, following Zhu Changlan's footsteps. They knew that Zhu Changlan's decision was correct. Even if they had to face the emperor's anger, they would fight side by side with Zhu Changlan, eliminating demons.

Inside the secret room, the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul had already noticed the movement outside. He floated in mid-air, black qi lingering around him, a trace of pride flashing in his eyes. "Zhu Changlan, didn't expect you to have this day!" The remnant soul's voice was hoarse and cold, "The emperor's suspicion, the royal family's alienation, are all planned by me. I just want to make you众叛亲离, die in despair!"

Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, cold voice: "So it was you behind the scenes! Black Bone Sect leader, today is your death day!"

"Death day?" The remnant soul sneered, "Zhu Changlan, you are too naive. Do you think you can beat me alone? Moreover, you now bear the charge of rebellion. Even if you kill me, you can't escape the emperor's pursuit."

"Even if I am smashed to pieces, I will drag you to hell with me!" Zhu Changlan roared, the wooden sword in his hand with golden demon power, stabbing fiercely towards the remnant soul.

The remnant soul was not to be outdone, the black qi around him suddenly surging, condensing into a huge bone sword, meeting Zhu Changlan. "Dang!" A loud sound, golden demon power and black evil qi collided, forming a powerful air wave, spreading around. The secret room walls were shaken by the air wave, gravel falling one after another.

A fierce battle began. Zhu Changlan and the remnant soul fought fiercely, golden demon power and black evil qi交织碰撞 in the secret room, emitting dazzling light. Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards assisted from the side, continuously attacking the remnant soul, trying to contain him.

The battle lasted for a whole day and night. Both Zhu Changlan and the remnant soul consumed a lot of energy, both seriously injured. Blood continued to overflow from Zhu Changlan's mouth, his combat uniform already dyed red with blood, but his eyes were still firm, the wooden sword in his hand never放下.

"Zhu Changlan, you're almost done!" The remnant soul gasped, a trace of madness flashing in his eyes, "Today, we will die together!" With that, the black qi around him suddenly surged, rushing towards Zhu Changlan, wanting to die together with him.

Zhu Changlan's eyes condensed, making a difficult decision in his heart. He猛地 pushed Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards away, his demon power suddenly erupting to the extreme, golden light wrapping his whole body. "Black Bone Sect leader, you休想 drag me to hell with you!" Zhu Changlan roared, the wooden sword in his hand stabbing fiercely towards the remnant soul's core.

"Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately stabbed into the remnant soul's core, golden demon power instantly poured in, crazily killing the remnant soul's soul. The remnant soul let out a shrill scream, the black qi around him quickly dissipated, finally turning into a wisp of smoke, completely disappearing in the secret room.

After eliminating the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, Zhu Changlan could no longer support himself, his body softening, falling down. Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards quickly stepped forward, supporting him.

"Your Highness, are you okay?" Daoist Xuanchen asked concernedly.

Zhu Changlan weakly shook his head, a trace of relief appearing at the corner of his mouth: "I'm okay...... The Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul has been eliminated...... The dynasty is safe...... No more worries......"

Just then, dense footsteps came from outside the secret room. The Jinyiwei dark guard commander's face changed, quickly saying: "Your Highness, it's bad! It's the imperial army sent from the capital! They are here to arrest you according to the decree!"

Zhu Changlan's face instantly turned pale. A greater crisis was waiting for him. Father's indifference, the royal family's alienation, finally pushed him into the abyss.

The imperial army quickly rushed into the secret room, surrounding Zhu Changlan and others. The imperial army commander held the imperial decree, cold voice: "Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, disobeying the decree, suspected of rebellion, immediately follow me back to the capital to accept investigation!"

Zhu Changlan was supported by the Jinyiwei dark guards, struggling to stand up. He looked at the imperial army commander, his eyes calm and firm: "My Zhu Changlan's life, has nothing to be ashamed of heaven and earth, nothing to be ashamed of the dynasty. I can go back to the capital with you, but I want to prove my innocence to Father."

With that, Zhu Changlan no longer resisted, letting the imperial army put him in shackles, escorting him out of the Demon Cave. Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards followed closely behind. They secretly swore in their hearts that even if they risked their lives, they would protect Zhu Changlan, return his innocence.

The sun set, the afterglow洒ing at the entrance of the Demon Cave, stretching Zhu Changlan's figure very long. Behind him, was the eliminated Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, traces of his bloody battles; in front of him, were cold shackles, Father's indifference, the royal family's alienation. He didn't know if he could prove his innocence, if he could get out of this crisis. But no matter how difficult the road ahead is, he will not give up. Because in his heart, there is still loyalty to the dynasty, adherence to brotherhood, and the last trace of expectation for that long-lost father-son affection.

In the direction of the capital, Zhu Yijun in Qianqing Palace was standing by the window, looking in the direction of the southern border. His eyes were still cold, but deep in his eyes, there was a trace of imperceptible complexity. He didn't know if his decision was right or wrong. He also didn't know how this storm caused by the royal family's alienation would end.

In the Eastern Palace, after learning that Zhu Changlan was arrested by the imperial army, Zhu Changluo was extremely anxious. Once Zhu Changlan is escorted back to the capital, the consequences are unimaginable. He must find a way to save Zhu Changlan, no matter what the cost.

In the cold palace, former Consort Zheng and deposed Crown Prince Zhu Changxun showed smug smiles after learning the news. They knew that their conspiracy had succeeded, and Zhu Changlan had fallen into an abyss from which he could never recover.

A storm surrounding Zhu Changlan is quietly brewing in the capital. The royal family's indifference and alienation, like an invisible net, has swept everyone into it. And Zhu Changlan, in the center of the net, is stepping step by step towards that unknown fate......

The prisoner cart rolled over the rugged mountain roads of the southern border, the friction between wheels and gravel making a harsh sound, moving slowly north, towards the direction of the capital. Zhu Changlan, wearing heavy black iron shackles, sat upright in the prisoner cart. The places where the shackles contacted his wrists and ankles were already worn into flesh and blood. Every bump of the car body牵扯着 the wounds, bringing piercing pain. But he seemed unaware, just slightly lowering his eyes, looking at the scenery quickly retreating outside the prisoner cart. The vegetation in the southern border was still lush, the mountain wind carried moist water vapor, but this vitality was completely incompatible with his current situation. His thoughts had already drifted back to the capital, back to that magnificent but cold palace.

He remembered the first time he saw Father as a child. At that time, he had just been brought into the palace, his thin body wrapped in an ill-fitting brocade robe, looking at the威严 man on the dragon throne from a distance, his heart full of awe and expectation. He mustered up the courage, wanting to step forward and say "Father, are you well", but just two steps, he was stopped by Father's cold eyes. That warm greeting, finally stuck in his throat, turning into silent cowardice. Later, he gradually grew up, learned the secret that he had demon power, and also understood why Father was so alienated from him------in the eyes of this emperor, he was never a beloved son, but a hidden danger that might threaten the dynasty's stability. Even the time when he played with Zhu Changluo and Zhu Changxun as children, now in retrospect, had a lot of indescribable feelings. At that time, Zhu Changluo treated him gently, would give him the sweetest snacks, would stand up to protect him when he was bullied by other princes; while Zhu Changxun always had a hint of hostility, his eyes full of contempt and jealousy. At that time, he thought that as long as he was obedient enough, worked hard enough, he could always win a trace of Father's warmth, always keep this simple brotherhood. But now it seems that all this was just his wishful thinking. In the royal family, family affection has long been worn away by power and suspicion, leaving only cold calculations and ruthless alienation.

The prisoner cart moved forward all the way. Wherever it passed, all the common people who knew his identity couldn't help pointing and pointing, their eyes full of fear and disdain. "This is that Ninth Prince with demon power? I heard he was eroded by demon qi in the southern border, intending to rebel!" "No wonder His Majesty wants to arrest him. This kind of monster should be lingchi executed, to warn others!" Gossip pierced into Zhu Changlan's ears like needles, but he didn't argue a word. Any argument at this moment is futile. Under Father's suspicion and the court's slander, he was already百口莫辩.

On the seventh day of the prisoner cart's journey, it finally entered the territory of Qingfeng Ridge. Here, the mountains are steep, the forests are lush, the sky-blocking branches cut the sunlight into pieces, the mountains are filled with faint mist, adding a bit of eerie and诡异. The imperial army commander escorting Zhu Changlan felt a faint unease in his heart. He knew this place was dangerous, and had already ordered the team to speed up, passing through this mountain range as soon as possible. But the more anxious you are, the faster accidents come.

Just as the team passed through a narrow mountain road, a sharp whistle suddenly sounded from the mountains on both sides. Immediately after, countless black shadows窜出 from the bushes, holding sharp blades, rushing fiercely towards the prisoner cart and the imperial army team.

"Ambush! Be on guard!" The imperial army commander roared, drawing his sword, commanding the imperial army to form a defensive formation. These ambushers were all skilled and ruthless, obviously well-trained dead soldiers, not ordinary mountain bandits. Their target was very clear, directly heading for the prisoner cart, obviously wanting to take Zhu Changlan's life.

Daoist Xuanchen and Zhu Changlan's Jinyiwei dark guards saw this, immediately drew their weapons, standing in front of the prisoner cart, fighting with the dead soldiers.

"Protect Your Highness!" The Jinyiwei dark guard commander shouted, his long sword twirling, killing a dead soldier rushing to the front. But the number of dead soldiers was too many, and they were fearless of death, so the imperial army and Jinyiwei dark guards soon fell into a bitter battle.

Zhu Changlan sat upright in the prisoner cart, watching the tragic battle in front of him, his heart cold. He clearly knew that these people were not mountain bandits, but came for him. Besides former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun, he couldn't think of anyone else who would be so eager to kill him.

The weight of the black iron shackles made his limbs numb, and the pain of the wounds hit again, but he could do nothing, only watching helplessly as people around him fell one by one.

Just then, the sound of horse hooves came from behind the mountain road, accompanied by the crisp sound of metal collision.

"By order of the Crown Prince, escort Ninth Prince safely back to the capital!" A loud shout broke the deadlock of the battle.只见 a team of elite guards disguised as merchants galloped而来, holding Eastern Palace tokens, their figures agile, quickly charging into the battlefield, counterattacking the dead soldiers.

These people were exactly the Eastern Palace elites secretly dispatched by Zhu Changluo. With their joining, the battlefield situation instantly reversed. Although the dead soldiers were fearless of death, they gradually fell into a disadvantage under the attack of the well-trained Eastern Palace elites and imperial army.

The leader of the dead soldiers saw the situation was bad, a trace of fierceness flashing in his eyes. He took out a signal flare from his arms, firing it into the sky. The signal flare exploded into a black firework in the air, obviously calling for reinforcements.

The Jinyiwei dark guard commander's face changed: "Not good, they have reinforcements! We must break through as soon as possible!"

Daoist Xuanchen nodded, a faint golden light appearing all over his body. With a wave of his dust whisk, several golden talismans flew out, accurately hitting several dead soldiers, knocking them flying.

"Quick, protect Your Highness and leave!" Daoist Xuanchen said in a deep voice.

The imperial army commander immediately reacted, commanding part of the imperial army to escort the prisoner cart, while the rest stayed behind to hold back.

The prisoner cart started again, speeding forward along the mountain road under the escort of the Eastern Palace elites. The sound of fighting behind gradually faded, but Zhu Changlan's heart was still heavy. He knew that this was just the beginning of the conspiracy by former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun. Even if he could safely arrive in the capital, what awaited him would be a more difficult game.

Three days later, the prisoner cart finally arrived at the outskirts of the capital. From a distance, Zhu Changlan saw the familiar city, the tall city walls standing tall, the city gates guarded strictly. But this once extremely familiar capital now looked like a huge cage, waiting for his entry.

In Qianqing Palace, after learning that Zhu Changlan had arrived at the outskirts of the capital, Zhu Yijun was silent for a long time, finally ordering: "Temporarily imprison Ninth Prince in the sky prison, wait until I find out the truth, then make a decision."

This decision neither immediately punished Zhu Changlan nor cleared him of his grievances, but temporarily put him on hold, obviously reflecting Zhu Yijun's contradictory state of mind.

After learning the news, Prime Minister Zhang breathed a slight sigh of relief. As long as Zhu Changlan was still alive, there was hope of clearing his grievances. He immediately found Zhu Changluo, discussing how to collect evidence as soon as possible to clear Zhu Changlan's name.

"Your Highness, now that Your Highness is imprisoned in the sky prison, we must find evidence of former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun framing Your Highness as soon as possible, otherwise the night is long and dreams are many." Prime Minister Zhang said in a凝重 tone.

Zhu Changluo nodded, his eyes full of determination: "Rest assured, Prime Minister Zhang, I have already sent people to investigate secretly, and I believe we will get results soon. In addition, I will personally go to the sky prison to visit Ninth Brother, tell him our plan, and let him rest assured."

But Zhu Changluo's visit request was rejected by Zhu Yijun. "As Crown Prince, you should prioritize the dynasty's overall situation, not neglect public affairs for personal reasons. Before the matter is clarified, you are not allowed to have private contact with Ninth Prince." The emperor's decree was cold and resolute, once again cutting off the connection between Zhu Changluo and Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changluo stood outside Qianqing Palace, looking at the closed hall door, feeling a deep sadness in his heart. Father's indifference once again made him feel the ruthlessness of the royal family. He still couldn't protect his brother.

Inside the sky prison, the environment was dark and damp, filled with a putrid smell. Zhu Changlan was imprisoned in a separate cell, the black iron shackles still on his body, colliding with the cold stone floor, making a dull sound. He leaned against the wall, closing his eyes and resting, his mind constantly recalling the experiences of this period. From fighting bloody battles in the southern border to Father's suspicion and the imperial decree, then to the ambush in Qingfeng Ridge, all of this was like a nightmare. He didn't know when his grievances would be cleared, or if he would ever see that day.

Just then, footsteps came from outside the cell. Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, seeing an eunuch walking in, holding a tray of food.

"Ninth Prince, this is specially sent by His Majesty." The eunuch placed the food on the stone platform at the cell door, his tone flat.

Zhu Changlan glanced at the food: four dishes and one soup, all his favorite flavors from childhood. His heart moved slightly. What did Father mean by this action? Was it guilt, or another form of temptation? He didn't immediately pick up his chopsticks, but quietly looked at the food, his heart in a turmoil.

At the same time, in the Eastern Palace, Zhu Changluo's investigation finally made progress. His people found former Consort Zheng's trusted maid, from whom they learned the entire process of former Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun secretly contacting the Minister of Rites to frame Zhu Changlan, and also obtained solid evidence. With this evidence, they could finally clear Zhu Changlan's innocence.

The long night was finally coming to an end, and the dawn of hope was quietly approaching.
