# Chapter 5: Millennium Fragments in Coma

1. Tranquility Peace Palace (Ninth Prince's residence)
2. Eastern Palace (Crown Prince's residence)
3. Snow Spirit Cat (Zhu Changlan's original form)
4. Black Bone Sect (Evil sect)
5. Demon Power (Power within demon cultivators)
6. Spirit Vein Source (Core of spiritual energy)
7. Spirit-Calming Jade (Protective jade from Kunlun Mountain)
8. Silk-Winding Step (Defensive movement technique)

The 25th year of the Wanli reign (1597) in the Ming Dynasty, late spring, the third hour of the day (5:00-7:00 AM).

The candles in the side hall of the Eastern Palace burned slowly, with lamp wicks forming and falling, casting flickering shadows on the entwined lotus patterns of the canopy. Zhu Changlan lay in the soft brocade quilt, his eyebrows tightly furrowed. The medicinal cloths on his shoulder and waist were mostly soaked with oozing blood, mingling with the strong scent of herbs, creating a heavy atmosphere in the air. His breathing was shallow and rapid, with fine cold sweat clinging to his eyelashes like dew on butterfly wings, trembling slightly, clearly trapped in a deeper coma than after the palace banquet assassination.

Crown Prince Zhu Changluo sat on the soft stool by the bed, his fingertips wrapped around Zhu Changlan's cold hand, his thumb repeatedly caressing the veins on the back of his hand, his eyes filled with unconcealed anxiety. The imperial hospital's chief physician had just hurried away with three imperial doctors, his expression grave as he repeatedly instructed: "Your Highness, the Ninth Prince's condition is more complicated than expected. At the palace banquet, he forcefully activated his millennium demon power to collide with the half-demon's black aura. Although he temporarily suppressed the injuries at the time, the demon power and black aura formed 'cold stagnation' in his meridians. When he briefly woke earlier, his stirred emotions caused the cold stagnation to spread instantly, not only tearing his wounds but also invading his spiritual consciousness. If he cannot untangle the chaotic forces within his body on his own, he may remain comatose indefinitely, or even have his spiritual consciousness shatter, never waking up again."

The Crown Prince's fingertips trembled slightly, his palm's warmth fruitlessly attempting to warm that coldness. Looking at Zhu Changlan's paper-white face, he remembered the terrifying scene half an hour ago—Zhu Changlan had slowly woken in his arms, weakly calling "Imperial Brother" with eyes still misty, but as soon as the words left his mouth, he suddenly coughed up blood, his body convulsing violently before falling into another coma, even his hand holding the Crown Prince's dropping weakly.

"Ninth Brother, wake up."

The Crown Prince's voice was as light as a sigh, with a faint, imperceptible sob, "I'm still waiting for your new osmanthus wine, waiting to accompany you to see the snow on Kunlun Mountain, waiting to take you out of the palace to travel the rivers and lakes. Don't sleep, okay?"

The person on the bed remained unresponsive, only furrowing his brows more tightly, a few faint groans escaping his throat like the whimper of a kitten enduring extreme pain—weak yet piercing the heart.

At this moment, Zhu Changlan's consciousness was floating in a chaotic void.

Surrounding him was endless darkness, no light, no sound, only a piercing chill seeping into his bones through every limb—this was the "cold stagnation" formed by the condensed half-demon black aura, like countless ice needles repeatedly piercing his meridians, or a black net tightly wrapping his spiritual consciousness, rendering him immobile. He wanted to move, but found his body as heavy as lead, unable to lift; he wanted to shout, but his throat felt like it was stuffed with ice-soaked cotton, making no sound.

After an unknown time, a faint light suddenly appeared in the darkness. The light was dim but carried a familiar warmth, like the morning sun at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, gradually dispelling the surrounding chill. Zhu Changlan's consciousness was drawn to this light, involuntarily drifting toward it.

The light grew brighter, gradually outlining a familiar scene—it was the Spiritual Valley at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, lush with vegetation, gurgling streams, and thick spiritual energy filling the air, the place where he first gained spiritual awareness.

Beneath an ancient tree by the stream, a pure white kitten was curled up sunbathing, its fluffy fur like a ball of snow. Its eyes were translucent amber, filled with innocent naivety, as it used its small paws to play with the grass leaves that fell on its body, occasionally letting out soft "meow~" sounds, sweet like honey.

That was him three hundred years ago, a Snow Spirit Cat who had just gained spiritual awareness.

In the Spiritual Valley, there was no conflict, no scheming, only warm sunshine, sweet stream water, and endless spirit fruits. His days were simple and pure: catching spirit fish in the stream at dawn, their bodies carrying faint spiritual energy, tender and sweet when bitten; basking in the sun on the branches of ancient trees at noon, sunlight filtering through the leaves, warm enough to make a cat drowsy; chasing fluorescent butterflies in the forest at dusk, the spirit powder falling from their wings nourishing his cultivation; nesting in the depths of a hay-filled tree hole at night, absorbing spiritual energy from heaven and earth, slowly refining his naive demon power.

At that time, he didn't know what loneliness or betrayal was, only learning to hunt from the elders in the clan, to avoid fierce beasts in the mountains, and to live safely in the Spiritual Valley. The oldest Spiritual Cat in the clan, with graying fur but still energetic, often lay beneath the ancient tree, licking his head with its rough tongue, telling him: "We Snow Spirit Cats are born with nine lives, beloved creatures of heaven and earth. As long as we cultivate diligently, we can transform into human form, achieve immortality, and see through people's hearts."

He was filled with longing, cultivating diligently every day. The stream, the ancient tree, the cave—all bore witness to his cultivation. He remembered the first time he successfully condensed a wisp of golden demon power, running ecstatically around the Spiritual Valley, looking at his reflection in the stream repeatedly, laughing so hard his eyes narrowed into slits, even "meowing" twice at the water as if showing off his achievement.

The light shifted, and the scene suddenly changed.

Still at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, but no longer the warm Spiritual Valley, but a frozen snowfield. Cold wind howled, kicking up snow everywhere, cutting his face like knives. The white kitten curled up behind a huge piece of black ice, its fur soaked with snow, frozen into ice shards, shivering. One of its hind legs oozed dark red blood, staining the snow beneath it, with black aura remaining at the wound—the mark of an evil demon's claw, its eyes filled with fear and helplessness.

This was his first life-and-death crisis at three hundred years old.

The clan had guarded the "Spirit Vein Source" deep in the Spiritual Valley for generations, the most concentrated spiritual energy spot at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, and the treasure coveted by countless evil demons. That night, a group of Black Bone Sect demons practicing dark arts raided the Spiritual Valley, their bodies wrapped in black aura, attacking ruthlessly. The elders of the clan fought to the death to protect the young and the Spirit Vein Source. In the chaos, he was clawed by a Black Bone Sect demon, his hind leg bone exposed, escaping from the sea of corpses with all his strength, hiding in this frozen snowfield.

The cold wind seemed to freeze his bones, the pain from his wound nearly fainting him, but he dared not sleep, fearing that if he closed his eyes, he would be torn apart by the pursuing demons. He curled up behind the black ice, licking his wound with his tongue, saliva mixing with blood and snow, forming ice on his face. He first tasted loneliness and despair, first realizing that the world wasn't only warm and beautiful.

Just as he was about to collapse, his consciousness fading, a gentle voice sounded in his ear: "Little one, don't be afraid."

He looked up with difficulty, seeing a Taoist in white robes holding a dust whisk, standing in the endless snow, surrounded by faint golden light, his eyes as gentle as spring sunshine. The Taoist gently picked him up, healing his wounds with warm spiritual energy that flowed through his meridians, dispelling the cold in his body and relieving the pain of his wound. The Taoist also fed him a crystal-clear pill that melted instantly in his mouth, a surge of pure spiritual energy flooding his body, lifting his exhausted spirit.

"You're a Snow Spirit Cat, born with nine lives, shouldn't die here."

The Taoist stroked his head, saying softly, "The world is dangerous, people's hearts unpredictable, and the demon realm even more so. You must learn to be strong, to protect yourself, and not trust anyone easily."

The Taoist stayed with him for three days in the snow, teaching him basic healing techniques and the defensive "Silk-Winding Step", and giving him a piece of warm ink jade, saying it was "Spirit-Calming Jade" from Kunlun Mountain, which could soothe the mind, aid his cultivation, and mask his demon aura to avoid detection by evil demons. Three days later, the Taoist was leaving, saying before departing: "Fate is predetermined by heaven. If we are destined, we will meet again. Remember, hold onto your true heart to achieve enlightenment."

Holding the ink jade, he stood in the snow, watching the Taoist's figure gradually disappear into the wind and snow, his eyes moist. From then on, he carried the ink jade, cultivating alone at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, evading the pursuit of Black Bone Sect demons while dedicating himself to cultivation, only to become stronger, no longer bullied, and one day repay the Taoist's life-saving grace.

The scene changed again, this time to a bustling human town.

Shops lined both sides of the street, with hawking, laughter, and the sound of carriages and horses endless. A young man in green robes, with clear and handsome features, wearing the ink jade at his waist, stood at the entrance of a teahouse, curiously observing his surroundings. His eyes were full of innocence and novelty, like a deer just emerging from the mountains, eager to explore everything in the human world.

This was what he looked like at five hundred years old, finally transformed into human form.

At the moment he transformed, he ran excitedly in the snow at the foot of Kunlun Mountain for a long time, looking at his reflection in the stream repeatedly, unable to calm down at the sight of the young man in white. Following the Taoist's instructions, he named himself "Xuan Yu" (Meta Jade), took the ink jade, and descended the mountain into the human world.

Everything in the human world fascinated him. He tasted sweet and glutinous osmanthus cakes for the first time, so sweet he narrowed his eyes; drank mellow rice wine for the first time, with the fragrance of grains warming his stomach; heard stories of chivalry from storytellers for the first time, their tales of heroism and vendettas filling him with longing; saw colorful lanterns during the Lantern Festival for the first time, their glow reflecting in the night sky, beautiful as a dream.

He wandered the streets, watching vendors hawk their goods, children play and chase, couples hold hands and snuggle, gradually longing to have such a lively life, to have someone to care about, to no longer wander alone.

But the human world was not a pure land. He soon witnessed the险恶 of human hearts. He was cheated by a greedy vendor when exchanging spirit fruits, receiving only a few copper coins; targeted by greedy cultivators who thought he had treasures due to his pure spiritual aura, chased madly; framed as a "demon" by the family of a drowning woman he saved out of kindness, almost burned alive on an altar.

This was his first disappointment with the human world, first realizing that human hearts could be more terrifying than the battles in the demon realm. He left the town with his body covered in wounds, continuing to wander the human world. He saw the scheming officialdom, where officials crushed each other for power, climbing over others' bones; saw martial arts sects killing each other for profit, their so-called "chivalry" crumbling in the face of gain; saw poor people struggling to survive, barely surviving under heavy taxes, with a full meal becoming a luxury; saw rich families waste extravagantly, throwing away money while turning a blind eye to the suffering of the poor.

He gradually learned to disguise himself, using the Taoist's spells to hide his demon aura, pretending to be an ordinary scholar; learned to be silent, no longer trusting anyone easily, no longer revealing his emotions; learned to protect himself in danger, using the "Silk-Winding Step" to avoid pursuit, using condensed demon power to counterattack, escaping danger time and time again. But the longing for warmth and companionship in his heart never died, like a seed buried in snow, waiting for spring to bloom.

The scene shifted, and a dense black aura suddenly surged from the darkness, instantly swallowing the human town before his eyes.

The piercing chill returned, more intense than the wind and snow at the foot of Kunlun Mountain—this was the aura of Black Bone Sect demons, of the same origin as the half-demon's black aura at the palace banquet, but more concentrated and evil. Zhu Changlan's consciousness fluctuated violently, feeling his demon power clashing madly within him, intertwining with the black aura, tearing his meridians, his spiritual consciousness like being alternately roasted and frozen, almost shattering.

He saw the Black Bone Sect demons, those monsters wrapped in black aura, the killers who attacked his clan. They held dripping weapons, their eyes ferocious, approaching him step by step, shouting "Hand over the Nine-Life Spirit Source", "Become the nourishment for our sect", "The nine lives of a Snow Spirit Cat are enough for the sect leader to break through his realm".

He wanted to run, but found himself entangled by the black aura, unable to move. He remembered the sight of his clan elders falling in battle, their bodies torn apart by demons, blood dyeing the stream of the Spiritual Valley; remembered his helplessness shivering in the snow, the pain of his wounds and the despair in his heart nearly swallowing him; remembered the malicious gazes in the human world, the framing and pursuit, making him lose faith in humanity. A huge wave of fear and anger surged in his heart, almost tearing his spiritual consciousness apart.

"No!"

He shouted in his mind, "I won't give up! I won't be bullied anymore! I'm no longer that weak and helpless kitten!"

His demon power suddenly erupted, golden demon power surging from the depths of his spiritual consciousness, colliding fiercely with the black aura. Golden demon power and black evil energy intertwined and tore in the air, making a shrill sound like metal scraping. His consciousness felt like it was being burned on fire then thrown into an ice cellar, the pain almost unbearable, but he clenched his teeth, refusing to give up—he couldn't die, he still had people to protect, wishes to fulfill.

Just then, a warm light suddenly surged from the depths of his spiritual consciousness—it was the dagger the Crown Prince gave him! The cat's eye stone on the hilt exploded with dazzling blue light in the darkness, like a solid barrier blocking the invasion of black aura. The light carried the Crown Prince's aura, gentle yet firm, like the temperature of the Crown Prince's palm, like the sandalwood of the side hall in the Eastern Palace, like his osmanthus wine, bringing reassuring warmth.

"Ninth Brother, don't be afraid, I'm here."

A familiar voice sounded in his ear, gentle yet firm, like spring sunshine dispelling the fear and despair in his heart. The voice called him repeatedly, with deep concern and reluctance, like a rope tightly pulling his spiritual consciousness, preventing him from falling into the abyss.

"Ninth Brother, wake up, I'm still waiting for you."

"Ninth Brother, you promised to brew osmanthus wine for me, you can't break your promise."

"Ninth Brother, with me here, no one can hurt you, come back quickly."

The Crown Prince's voice became clearer and closer, and the blue light of the cat's eye stone grew stronger, gradually dispelling the surrounding black aura, soothing his chaotic demon power, and mending his damaged meridians. Zhu Changlan felt a gentle power flowing into his body through the dagger, merging with his demon power to fight the remaining cold stagnation, his spiritual consciousness gradually clearing.

He tried hard to open his eyes, to see the owner of that voice, to respond to his call, but his eyelids were still as heavy as lead, only able to desperately move toward the direction of the voice in his consciousness.

The scene changed again, this time to the courtyard of Tranquility Peace Palace. Tranquility Peace Palace was located in the western part of the inner court, a residence specially arranged for Zhu Changlan by the Empress. The main hall hung the plaque "Cian" (慈安), written by the Empress herself, and the courtyard had several hundred-year-old osmanthus trees planted by the Empress.

Warm sunlight spilled on the ground, the osmanthus trees in the courtyard full of golden flowers, their fragrance so rich it was intoxicating. He lay on a pear wood recliner, covered with a plain silk blanket, the Crown Prince sitting on a stone stool beside him, holding a scroll, reading Li Bai's poems softly, his voice gentle like spring breeze over a lake. Wind blew through the leaves, making a "rustling" sound, interweaving with the Crown Prince's reading voice, forming the most tender melody.

"Imperial Brother, you read so beautifully." He said with a smile, his voice soft and lazy.

The Crown Prince put down the scroll, reaching out to gently ruffle his hair, his eyes full of doting: "If you like it, I'll read to you every day. When you get better, we'll go to the Imperial Garden to admire peonies, okay?"

He nodded, leaning comfortably on the Crown Prince's shoulder, closing his eyes, feeling the warmth around him. Sunlight, flower fragrance, reading voice, his brother's company—everything was so beautiful it felt like a dream, making him reluctant to wake up.

But this dream was soon shattered.

Consort Zheng burst into Tranquility Peace Palace with a group of palace servants, her face狰狞 with a smile, followed by the Third Prince Zhu Changxun and several Black Bone Sect demons. "Zhu Changlan, you monster, how dare you bewitch the Crown Prince, defiling the royal bloodline! Today I'll act on behalf of heaven to eliminate you!" Consort Zheng's voice was sharp and piercing, like nails scraping glass.

The Third Prince Zhu Changxun followed behind Consort Zheng, holding a long sword emitting black aura, the same weapon used by the half-demon at the palace banquet: "Ninth Brother, don't blame me for being ruthless. Blame yourself for standing in my way. The Crown Prince's position and the imperial throne should all be mine!"

The Crown Prince immediately stood in front of him, spreading his arms like a reliable mountain, protecting him behind: "Who dares to touch Ninth Brother, must pass through me first! Consort Zheng, Third Brother, how dare you collude with demons, plotting rebellion! Aren't you afraid of Father's punishment?"

Consort Zheng sneered, her eyes venomous: "Crown Prince, are you still delusional at this point! When you and this monster die, the Emperor will naturally appoint Yu'er as Crown Prince. Who will investigate our crimes? Today, both of you brothers will die here!"

The palace servants and demons swarmed forward, brandishing weapons, slashing at them. The Crown Prince fought hard, but he was only a mortal, no match for demons, quickly exhausting his strength, his arm cut open by a demon's claw, blood flowing, staining his bright yellow casual clothes.

"Imperial Brother!" He roared, trying to rush forward, but was held tightly by the palace servants beside Consort Zheng, unable to move.

He watched as the Crown Prince was knocked down by demons again and again, struggling to get up each time, his blood dyeing the bluestone slabs of Tranquility Peace Palace, his eyes gradually becoming weary but still not backing down. His heart ached like being cut by a knife, more painful than his own injuries.

"Imperial Brother, no!"

His tears flowed uncontrollably, struggling desperately, "I'm not worth it! Run away, don't worry about me!"

The Crown Prince turned back, giving him a gentle smile like spring sunshine, dispelling the surrounding darkness: "Ninth Brother, you're my only brother. Protecting you is what I should do. Even if I die, I won't let you get hurt."

Just then, the Third Prince's long sword stabbed toward the Crown Prince's back, the black aura on the sword almost solidifying, carrying fatal killing intent.

"No!"

Zhu Changlan suddenly opened his eyes, gasping for breath, cold sweat rolling down his cheeks, soaking the pillow and the medicinal cloth on his shoulder. His heart raced, the air in his chest so thin it suffocated him. The dream had been too real, the fear, despair, and pain still lingering in his senses, making his whole body tremble slightly.

"Ninth Brother! You're awake!"

A familiar voice sounded in his ear, filled with undisguised joy and relief. Zhu Changlan turned his head, seeing the Crown Prince sitting by his bed, his eyes slightly red, full of concern, reaching out to touch him but afraid of hurting him, his movements careful and gentle.

"Imperial Brother......"

Zhu Changlan's voice was hoarse, thick with鼻音, tears once again streaming down his face uncontrollably.

The Crown Prince quickly helped him sit up, placing a soft brocade pillow behind him, then handed over a cup of warm water, scooping a little with a spoon, bringing it to his lips: "Drink slowly, don't choke."

Zhu Changlan opened his mouth, the warm liquid sliding down his throat, slightly alleviating the dryness of his throat and the suffocation in his chest. He looked at the Crown Prince, remembering his figure shielding him in the dream, his unhesitating protection at the palace banquet, his repeated calls while he was comatose. His heart filled with warmth, both sour and swollen.

"I'm sorry, Imperial Brother."

He sobbed, "It's all because of me that you're in danger, that you're hurt. If I hadn't forcefully activated my demon power to protect you, I wouldn't have formed cold stagnation, wouldn't have fallen into another coma, making you worry."

The Crown Prince reached out, gently wiping the tears from his face with his sleeve, his fingertips warm and dry: "Silly brother, what nonsense are you talking about. You protect me, I protect you—that's what brothers should do."

He paused, his eyes gentle and firm, "Moreover, you waking up is more important than anything. No matter how long you're comatose, I'll be here waiting for you until you wake up."

Zhu Changlan leaned on the Crown Prince's shoulder, tears soaking his robes. He knew that he could wake up from that chaotic coma, break free from those millennium fragments of pain, all because of the Crown Prince. It was the Crown Prince's calls, the Crown Prince's company, the warmth given by the Crown Prince, like a beam of light illuminating his dark consciousness, pulling him out of the abyss.

He remembered the millennium fragments in his coma, the Spiritual Valley at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, the Taoist's life-saving grace, the wandering and ups and downs in the human world, those lonely and desperate days. These memories, like dust-covered pearls, were awakened by this coma, connecting the trajectory of his nearly millennium-long life.

He had lived for nearly a thousand years, experiencing the cruel battles of the demon realm, the vicissitudes of the human world, seeing too much scheming, too much separation between life and death, long accustomed to loneliness, to disguise, to facing everything alone. He thought he would continue wandering like this until his soul scattered, never expecting to meet someone who truly treated him well in this cold palace.

The Crown Prince's appearance was like a warm sun, illuminating his life that had been lonely for nearly a thousand years; the Crown Prince's company was like a cup of warm wine, warming his frozen heart; the Crown Prince's protection was like a mountain, giving him unprecedented security.

"Imperial Brother,"

Zhu Changlan looked up at the Crown Prince, his eyes full of sincerity and determination, tears still hanging from his lashes, yet shining with an unprecedented resolve, "From now on, I won't let you get hurt again. I'll quickly untangle my demon power, completely eliminate the cold stagnation, and become stronger. I'll use my nine lives, my millennium cultivation, to protect you for a lifetime, to protect your smooth succession to the throne, to protect the safety of the Ming Dynasty."

The Crown Prince looked at the light in his eyes, a warm current surging in his heart. He knew that after this coma, after those millennium memories, his Ninth Brother had truly grown up. He reached out, gently patting his shoulder, his strength steady and gentle: "Alright, I believe you. We brothers will face everything together, no matter how many storms lie ahead, no matter how many demons cause trouble, no matter how many hidden arrows in the court—we'll bear it together."

The sky outside had already brightened, morning light filtering through the window, casting a golden veil over them, warm and holy. Zhu Changlan leaned on the Crown Prince's shoulder, feeling the warmth around him, listening to his steady and powerful heartbeat, his heart filled with unprecedented peace. He could clearly feel a change in his body—a slight stabbing pain in his dantian, followed by a warm current surging, this was the unique Nine-Life Power of the Snow Spirit Cat bloodline awakening.

It turned out that when he fought against the black aura in his coma, he had used the power of his first life to protect his consciousness from being swallowed. Although he saved his life, he could feel that one of his nine lives had quietly passed. This realization made his heart sink, but also strengthened his resolve to protect his brother and the Ming Dynasty.

Those millennium fragments, those painful memories, would all become nourishment for his growth. From now on, he would no longer be the Ninth Prince who only wanted to hide in Tranquility Peace Palace as a wealthy idle person, no longer the lonely wandering Snow Spirit Cat Xuan Yu. Tranquility Peace Palace was his safe haven in the deep palace, a testament to the Empress's love for him, a bond of brotherhood between him and the Crown Prince, and the starting point of his growth. He was the younger brother of Crown Prince Zhu Changluo, the adopted son of the Empress, the Millennium Cultivator Immortal Meta Jade, the guardian about to embark on the path of Nine-Life Trial. He would protect the people he cared about, protect this hard-won brotherhood, protect this motherly love from the Empress, protect the only warmth in this deep palace.

He closed his eyes, a faint smile on his lips. The sun was just right, time was peaceful, with his brother by his side and warmth accompanying him—this was the life he had desired for nearly a thousand years. And he would use his remaining eight lives to protect this beauty.
