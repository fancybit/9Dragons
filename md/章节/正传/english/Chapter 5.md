# Chapter 5: Fragments of a Thousand Years in Coma

The 25th Year of Wanli, Ming Dynasty, Late Spring, Third Quarter of the Tiger Hour.

The candle in the East Palace side hall burned very slowly, the wick结了又落, casting flickering light on the intertwined lotus patterns of the canopy. Zhu Changlan was trapped in the soft brocade quilt, his brows tightly furrowed, the bandages on his shoulder and waist already half-stained with seeping blood, mixed with the strong scent of medicine, forming a heavy atmosphere in the air. His breathing was shallow and rapid, his eyelashes dotted with fine cold sweat, like butterfly wings covered with morning dew, trembling gently, clearly陷入 a deeper coma than after the palace banquet assassination.

Crown Prince Zhu Changluo sat on a soft stool by the bed, his fingertips gripping his cold hand, his thumb repeatedly caressing the blue veins on the back of his hand, his eyes filled with undeniable anxiety. The head of the Imperial Medical Academy had just left in a hurry with three imperial physicians, his face grave as he repeatedly instructed: "Your Royal Highness, the Ninth Prince's condition is more troublesome than expected. To protect you at the palace banquet, he forcibly催动 a thousand years of demon power to collide with the half-demon black aura. Although he temporarily suppressed the injury at the time, it caused the demon power and black aura to form 'cold stagnation' in his meridians. When he regained consciousness for a moment earlier, his mind stirred, and the cold stagnation instantly spread, not only tearing his wounds but also invading his spirit. If he cannot naturally regulate the chaotic power within him, he will remain in a coma, and his spirit may even dissipate, never waking up again."

The Crown Prince's fingertips trembled slightly, his palm's warmth futilely trying to warm the coldness. Looking at Zhu Changlan's paper-white face, he remembered the terrifying scene half an hour ago
------ Zhu Changlan slowly woke up in his arms, weakly calling
"Elder Brother", his eyes still watery, but no sooner had the words left his mouth than he suddenly coughed up blood, his body convulsing violently, falling into a coma again, even his hand holding his arm无力地 dropping.

"Ninth Brother, wake up."
The Crown Prince's voice was as light as a sigh, with a barely detectable sob, "I'm still waiting for your new osmanthus wine, waiting to accompany you to see the snow on Kunlun Mountain, waiting to take you out of the palace to travel the rivers and lakes. Don't sleep anymore, okay?"

The person on the bed gave no response, only furrowing his brows tighter, a few faint moans escaping his throat, like a kitten's whimper when enduring extreme pain, weak yet piercing the heart.

At this moment, Zhu Changlan's consciousness was floating in chaos.

All around was endless darkness, no light, no sound, only a piercing coldness, drilling into his bones and marrow
------ This was the "cold stagnation" formed by the half-demon black aura, like countless ice needles repeatedly piercing his meridians, like a black net tightly wrapping his spirit, rendering him immobile. He wanted to move, but found his body as heavy as lead, unable to lift; wanted to shout, but his throat felt blocked with ice-soaked cotton, unable to make a sound.

After an unknown amount of time, a faint light suddenly appeared in the darkness. The light was faint but carried a familiar warmth, like the morning light under Kunlun Mountain, gradually dispelling the surrounding coldness. Zhu Changlan's consciousness was attracted to the light, involuntarily drifting toward its source.

The light grew brighter, gradually outlining a familiar scene ------
It was the spirit valley under Kunlun Mountain, lush with vegetation, a stream gurgling, the air filled with rich spiritual energy, the place where he first opened his spirit wisdom.

Under an ancient tree by the stream, a snow-white kitten was curled up sunbathing, its fur fluffy and soft, like a ball of snow. Its eyes were transparent amber, full of naive innocence, using its small paws to play with the grass leaves falling on its body, occasionally making soft
"Meow～" sounds, sweet as soaked in honey.

That was him three hundred years ago, a snow spirit cat who had just developed spirit wisdom.

The spirit valley had no conflicts, no scheming, only warm sunlight, sweet stream water, and endless spiritual fruits. His days were simple and pure: in the morning, catching spiritual fish in the stream, their bodies carrying a faint spiritual energy, tender and sweet when bitten; in the afternoon, sunbathing on the branches of a thousand-year-old tree, sunlight filtering through the leaves, warm enough to make a cat drowsy; in the evening, chasing the fluorescent butterflies in the forest, the spiritual powder falling from their wings nourishing his cultivation; at night, nesting in the depths of a tree hole lined with dry grass, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, slowly polishing his naive demon power.

At that time, he didn't know what loneliness or betrayal was, only knowing to follow the elders in the clan to learn hunting, to avoid mountain beasts, to learn how to live peacefully in this spirit valley. The oldest elder in the clan, his fur already graying, still spry, often lay under the ancient tree, licking his head with a rough tongue, telling him: "We snow spirit cats are born with nine lives, beloved by heaven and earth. As long as we cultivate with dedication, we can transform into human form, achieve immortality, and see through people's hearts."

He was full of longing, cultivating diligently every day. By the stream, under the ancient tree, in the cave, his cultivation身影 could be seen everywhere. He remembered the first time he successfully condensed a wisp of golden demon power, excitedly running a full circle in the spirit valley, looking at himself in the stream, admiring his fluffy reflection, squinting his eyes with a smile, and
"Meowing" twice at the stream, as if showing off his achievement.

The light flowed, the scene suddenly changing.

Still under Kunlun Mountain, but no longer the warm spirit valley, but a frozen snowfield. The wind howled,卷起漫天飞雪, cutting the face like a knife. The snow-white kitten huddled behind a huge black ice, its fur soaked with snow, frozen into ice shards, trembling. One of its hind legs was bleeding dark red blood, staining the white snow beneath, black aura remaining at the wound
------ It was a mark left by an evil demon's claws, its eyes full of fear and helplessness.

This was his first life-or-death crisis at 300 years old.

For generations, his clan had guarded the "Spiritual Vein Source" deep in the spirit valley, the most spiritually rich place under Kunlun Mountain, and a treasure coveted by countless evil demons. That night, a group of Black Bone Sect demons practicing evil arts突袭 the spirit valley, wrapped in black aura, attacking fiercely. The elders in the clan fought to protect the young cubs and the Spiritual Vein Source, all dying in battle. In the chaos, he was scratched by a Black Bone Sect demon's claw, his hind leg bone exposed, struggling with all his strength to escape from the sea of corpses and blood, hiding in this frozen snowfield.

The wind felt like it would freeze his bones, the pain from his wound almost making him faint, but he dared not sleep, fearing that if he closed his eyes, he would be torn apart by the pursuing demons. Huddled behind the black ice, he licked his wound with his tongue, saliva mixing with blood and snow, freezing on his face. For the first time, he experienced loneliness and despair, for the first time realizing that the world was not only warm and beautiful.

Just as he was about to collapse, a gentle voice sounded in his ear: "Little one, don't be afraid."

He raised his head with difficulty, seeing a Daoist in white robes, holding a dust whisk, standing in the flying snow, surrounded by a faint golden light, his eyes as gentle as spring sunlight. The Daoist gently picked him up, using warm spiritual energy to heal his wounds, which flowed through his meridians like a warm current, dispelling the cold in his body, alleviating the pain of his wound. The Daoist also fed him a crystal-clear pill, which melted instantly in his mouth, a pure spiritual energy surging throughout his body, reviving his weary spirit.

"You are a snow spirit cat, born with nine lives, you shouldn't die here."
The Daoist stroked his head, softly saying, "This world is dangerous, people's hearts are unpredictable, and the demon realm is even more about the strong preying on the weak. You must learn to be strong, learn to protect yourself, don't easily trust anyone."

The Daoist stayed with him for three days, teaching him basic healing techniques and defensive
"Entwined Silk Step", also giving him a warm jet-black jade, saying it was "Spirit Calming Jade" from Kunlun Mountain, which could calm the mind, aid his cultivation, and mask his demon aura to avoid detection by evil demons. After three days, the Daoist was leaving, saying to him before departing: "Fate is predestined by heaven. If we are destined, we will meet again. Remember,守住本心,方能修成正果."

Holding the jet-black jade, standing in the snow, watching the Daoist's figure gradually disappear into the wind and snow, his eyes moistened. From then on, he carried the jade, cultivating alone under Kunlun Mountain, avoiding the pursuit of Black Bone Sect demons while devoting himself to cultivation, determined to become stronger, no longer allowing himself to be bullied, and hoping to repay the Daoist's life-saving grace one day.

The scene shifted again, this time to a lively human town.

Shops lined both sides of the street, with constant hawking, laughter, and the sound of carriages. A young man in green robes, with handsome features and a gentle face, wearing the jet-black jade at his waist, stood at the entrance of a tea house, curiously observing everything around him. His eyes were full of innocence and novelty, like a deer just emerging from the mountains, curious about everything in the human world.

This was his appearance after finally transforming into a human form at 500 years old.

The moment he transformed into a human, he was so excited that he ran for a long time in the snow under Kunlun Mountain, looking at himself in the stream, gazing at the white-robed young man in the water, unable to calm down for a long time. Following the Daoist's instructions, he named himself
"Xuan Yu", and with the jet-black jade, he descended the mountain into the human world.

Everything in the human world fascinated him. He tasted sweet and soft osmanthus cakes for the first time, so sweet he squinted his eyes; drank mellow rice wine for the first time, with the fragrance of grain, warming his stomach; heard stories of rivers and lakes from storytellers for the first time, the grudges and enmities of those chivalrous men making him yearn; saw lanterns during the Lantern Festival for the first time, colorful lanterns reflecting the night sky, as beautiful as a dream.

Walking down the street, watching vendors hawk their goods, children playing and chasing, couples walking hand in hand, a longing gradually arose in his heart
------ He also wanted to have such a lively life, to have someone to care about, to no longer wander alone.

But the human world is not a pure land. He soon witnessed the险恶 side of human hearts. He was cheated by a greedy vendor when exchanging spiritual fruits for goods, only getting a few copper coins; his pure spiritual energy was detected by greedy cultivators, who mistakenly thought he had a treasure and chased him crazily; he saved a drowning woman out of kindness, only to be framed as a
"demon" by the woman's family, nearly burned alive on an altar.

That was the first time he was disappointed in the human world, the first time he realized that human hearts were more terrifying than demon realm battles. He left that town with countless injuries, continuing to wander in the human world. He saw the intrigue in officialdom, where officials trampled on others to climb higher; saw martial arts sects killing each other for profit,所谓的
"chivalry" crumbling in the face of profit; saw the struggling poor, surviving under heavy taxes, their basic needs unmet; also saw the extravagant rich, spending money lavishly while turning a blind eye to the suffering of the lower classes.

He gradually learned to disguise himself, using the Daoist's teachings to hide his demon aura, pretending to be an ordinary scholar; learned to be silent, no longer easily trusting anyone, no longer easily revealing his emotions; learned to protect himself in times of danger, using
"Entwined Silk Step"
To dodge pursuit, using condensed demon power to counterattack, turning danger into safety time and again. But the desire for warmth and companionship in his heart never extinguished, like a seed buried deep in snow, waiting for the spring flowers to bloom.

The scene shifted, and a thick black aura suddenly surged from the darkness, instantly swallowing the human town before him.

The piercing coldness struck again, more intense than the wind and snow under Kunlun Mountain
------ This was the aura of Black Bone Sect demons, the same source as the half-demon's black aura at the palace banquet, but more concentrated and evil. Zhu Changlan's consciousness fluctuated violently, feeling the demon power within him collide frantically with the black aura, tearing his meridians, his spirit like being burned by fire then frozen in an ice cellar, repeatedly tormented.

He saw the Black Bone Sect demons, those monsters wrapped in black aura, the murderers who attacked his clan. They held dripping weapons, their eyes ferocious, approaching him step by step, shouting
"Hand over the Nine Lives Spiritual Source""Become our nourishment""The Ninth Prince's nine lives are enough to help the sect leader break through his realm".

He wanted to escape, but found himself entangled by the black aura, unable to move. He remembered the appearance of his clan elders dying in battle, their bodies torn apart by demons, blood dyeing the stream of the spirit valley; remembered his helplessness freezing in the snow, the pain of his wound and inner despair almost consuming him; remembered the malicious eyes in the human world, the framing and pursuit that made him lose faith in humanity. A great fear and anger rose in his heart, almost tearing his spirit apart.

"No!"
He screamed in his heart, "I won't admit defeat! I won't let myself be bullied anymore! I'm no longer that weak and helpless kitten!"

The demon power within him suddenly erupted, golden demon power surging from the depths of his spirit, colliding fiercely with the black aura. The golden demon power and black evil energy intertwined and tore in the air, making a shrill sound like metal scraping. His consciousness was like being roasted over fire then thrown into an ice cellar, pain so intense it was almost unbearable, but he bit his teeth, refusing to give up
------ He couldn't die, he still had someone to protect, still had unfulfilled wishes.

Just then, a warm light suddenly surged from the depths of his spirit
------ It was the dagger sent by the Crown Prince! The cat's eye stone on the handle burst into a brilliant blue light in the darkness, like a solid barrier, blocking the black aura's invasion. The light carried the Crown Prince's aura, gentle yet firm, like the Crown Prince's palm temperature, like the sandalwood in the East Palace side hall, like his brewed osmanthus wine, carrying a reassuring warmth.

"Ninth Brother, don't be afraid, I'm here."

The familiar voice sounded in his ear, gentle yet firm, like spring sunlight, dispelling his fear and despair. The voice called out to him over and over, filled with deep concern and reluctance, like a rope tightly pulling his spirit, preventing him from falling into the abyss.

"Ninth Brother, wake up, I'm still waiting for you."

"Ninth Brother, you promised to brew me osmanthus wine, don't break your promise."

"Ninth Brother, with me here, no one can hurt you, come back quickly."

The Crown Prince's call became clearer and closer, the blue light of the cat's eye stone growing more intense, gradually dispelling the surrounding black aura, soothing his chaotic demon power, combing his damaged meridians. Zhu Changlan felt a gentle power flowing into his body from the dagger, merging with his demon power, together resisting the remaining cold stagnation, his spirit gradually clearing.

He struggled to open his eyes, wanting to see the owner of the voice, wanting to respond to his call, but his eyelids were still as heavy as lead, only able to desperately approach the direction of the voice in his consciousness.

The scene shifted again, this time to the courtyard of Xian'an Palace. Xian'an Palace, located on the west side of the inner court, was specially arranged for Zhu Changlan by the Empress. The main hall hung the plaque "Ci An" (慈安), written by the Empress herself, and the courtyard planted with several hundred-year-old osmanthus trees, personally planted by the Empress.

The sun shone warmly on the ground, the osmanthus trees in the courtyard full of golden flowers, their fragrance rich enough to make one drunk. He lay on the pear wood reclining chair, covered with a plain soft silk blanket, the Crown Prince sitting on a stone stool beside him, holding a scroll, softly reciting Li Bai's poems, his voice gentle, like spring breeze brushing the lake. The wind blew through the leaves, making a
"沙沙" sound, interweaving with the Crown Prince's reading, composing the gentlest melody.

"Elder Brother, you read really nicely." He said with a smile, his voice soft, with a hint of laziness.

The Crown Prince put down the scroll, reaching out to gently ruffle his hair, his eyes full of doting: "If you like it, I'll read to you every day. When you feel better, let's go to the Imperial Garden to appreciate peonies, okay?"

He nodded, comfortably leaning on the Crown Prince's shoulder, closing his eyes, feeling the warmth around him. Sunlight, flower fragrance, reading, brotherly companionship, all so beautiful it felt like a dream, making him reluctant to wake up.

But this dream was soon shattered.

Consort Zheng burst into Xian'an Palace with a group of palace people, her face with a狰狞 smile, followed by Third Prince Zhu Changxun and several Black Bone Sect demons. "Zhu Changlan, you demon, how dare you seduce the Crown Prince, tainting the royal bloodline! Today, I'll act on behalf of heaven and eliminate you!"
Consort Zheng's voice was shrill and piercing, like nails scraping glass.

Third Prince Zhu Changxun followed behind Consort Zheng, holding a long sword glowing with black aura, the same weapon used by the half-demon at the palace banquet: "Ninth Brother, don't blame me for being cruel, blame yourself for blocking my path. The Crown Prince's position and the country should all be mine!"

The Crown Prince immediately stood in front of him, spreading his arms like a reliable mountain, protecting him behind him: "Whoever dares to touch Ninth Brother must go through me first! Consort Zheng, Third Brother, how dare you collude with demons and plot rebellion? Aren't you afraid of the Emperor's punishment?"

Consort Zheng sneered, her eyes cold and fierce: "Your Royal Highness, at this point, you're still delusional! When you and this demon are dead, the Emperor will naturally make Yu'er the Crown Prince, and no one will追究 our responsibility. Today, both of you brothers will die here!"

The palace people and demons swarmed forward, holding weapons, slashing at them. Although the Crown Prince had practiced martial arts, it was just for fitness, no match for demons. Soon he was exhausted, his arm cut by a demon's claw, blood flowing freely, staining his bright yellow robe.

"Elder Brother!" He roared, wanting to rush forward, but was held tightly by Consort Zheng's palace people, unable to move.

He watched the Crown Prince fall again and again to protect him, then struggle to get up again and again, watched his blood dye the bluestone of Xian'an Palace, watched his eyes gradually become weary yet never retreating, his heart aching like being cut by a knife, more painful than his own injury.

"Elder Brother, no!"
His tears poured out, struggling frantically, "I'm not worth it! Run away quickly, don't worry about me!"

The Crown Prince turned back, showing him a gentle smile, like spring sunlight dispelling the surrounding darkness: "Ninth Brother, you're my only brother. Protecting you is what I should do. Even if I die, I won't let you get hurt."

Just then, Third Prince's long sword stabbed toward the Crown Prince's back, the black aura on the sword almost solidified, carrying fatal intent.

"No!"

Zhu Changlan suddenly opened his eyes, gasping for breath, cold sweat sliding down his cheeks, soaking the pillow and the bandages on his shoulders. His heart was racing, the air in his chest so thin it suffocated him. The previous dream was too real, those fears, despair, and pain still lingering in his senses, making his whole body tremble slightly.

"Ninth Brother! You're awake!"

A familiar voice sounded in his ear, filled with uncontrollable joy and relief. Zhu Changlan turned his head, seeing the Crown Prince sitting beside his bed, his eyes slightly red, full of concern, reaching out to touch him yet afraid to hurt him, his movements cautious.

"Elder Brother......"
Zhu Changlan's voice was hoarse beyond recognition, with a strong nasal tone, tears again flowing uncontrollably.

The Crown Prince quickly helped him sit up, placing a soft brocade pillow behind him, then handed over a cup of warm water, using a spoon to scoop some, bringing it to his mouth: "Drink slowly, don't choke."

Zhu Changlan opened his mouth, the warm liquid sliding down his throat, slightly relieving the dryness of his throat and suffocation in his chest. Looking at the Crown Prince, he remembered the scene of him standing in front of him in the dream, remembered his selfless protection at the palace banquet, remembered his repeated calls when he was in a coma. His heart was filled with warmth, both sore and full.

"Elder Brother, I'm sorry."
He choked out, "It's all because of me that you encountered danger and got injured. If I hadn't forcibly used my demon power to protect you, there wouldn't be cold stagnation, and I wouldn't have fallen into a coma again, making you worry."

The Crown Prince reached out, using his sleeve to gently wipe the tears from his face, his fingertips warm and dry: "Silly brother, what are you saying. You protect me, and I protect you, that's what brothers should do." He paused, his eyes gentle and firm, "Moreover, your awakening is more important than anything. No matter how long you're in a coma, I will stay here by your side until you wake up."

Zhu Changlan leaned on the Crown Prince's shoulder, tears soaking his robe. He knew that he could wake up from this chaotic coma, could break free from those thousand-year-old painful fragments, all because of the Crown Prince. It was the Crown Prince's call, the Crown Prince's companionship, the warmth given by the Crown Prince, like a ray of light illuminating his dark consciousness, pulling him out of the abyss.

He remembered those thousand-year-old fragments in his coma, remembered the spirit valley under Kunlun Mountain, remembered the Daoist's life-saving grace, remembered his wandering and the warmth and coldness of the human world, remembered those lonely and desperate days. Those memories, like dust-covered pearls, were awakened by this coma, connecting the trajectory of his nearly thousand-year life.

He had lived for nearly a thousand years, experiencing cruel battles in the demon realm, the coldness of human nature, witnessing too much intrigue, too many partings of life and death. He had long been accustomed to loneliness, to disguise, to facing everything alone. He thought he would continue wandering like this until his soul dissipated, never expecting to meet someone like the Crown Prince in this cold deep palace, someone who truly treated him with sincerity.

The Crown Prince's appearance was like a warm sun, illuminating his nearly thousand-year lonely life; the Crown Prince's companionship was like a cup of warm wine, warming his frozen heart; the Crown Prince's protection was like a reliable mountain, giving him unprecedented security.

"Elder Brother,"
Zhu Changlan raised his head, looking into the Crown Prince's eyes, his gaze full of sincerity and determination, tears still hanging from his eyelashes, yet revealing a决绝 he had never shown before, "From now on, I won't let you get hurt again. I will quickly regulate the demon power in my body, completely eliminate the cold stagnation, and become stronger. I will use my nine lives, my thousand years of cultivation, to protect you for a lifetime, protect you in顺利 ascending the throne, protect this Ming Dynasty's江山 from harm."

The Crown Prince looked at the light in his eyes, a warm current surging in his heart. He knew that after this coma, after those thousand-year memories, his Ninth Brother had truly grown up. He reached out, gently patting his shoulder, his strength steady and gentle: "Good, I believe you. We brothers will face it together. No matter how many storms lie ahead, no matter how many demons作祟, no matter how many hidden daggers in the court, we will bear them together."

The sky outside was already bright, morning light filtering through the window lattice, casting a golden veil over the two of them, warm and holy. Zhu Changlan leaned on the Crown Prince's shoulder, feeling the warmth around him, listening to his steady and powerful heartbeat, his heart filled with unprecedented peace. He could clearly feel a certain change in his body— a slight stabbing pain from the depths of his dantian, followed by a warm current surging, that was the awakening of the Nine Lives power unique to the snow spirit cat bloodline.

It turned out that when he fought against the black aura in his coma, to protect his consciousness from being devoured, he had already used the power of his first life. Although he保住了 his life, he could feel that one of his nine lives had quietly passed. This realization made his heart sink, yet it strengthened his determination to protect his elder brother and the Ming Dynasty.

Those thousand-year-old fragments, those painful memories, would all become nutrients for his growth. From now on, he would no longer be the Ninth Prince who only wanted to hide in Xian'an Palace as a wealthy idler, no longer the lonely wandering snow spirit cat Xuan Yu. Xian'an Palace was his safe haven in the deep palace, a witness to the Empress's love for him, a bond of brotherhood between him and the Crown Prince, and the starting point of his growth. He was the brother of Crown Prince Zhu Changluo, the adopted son of the Empress, Xuan Yu True Immortal with a thousand years of cultivation, the guardian about to embark on the Nine Lives training path. He would protect the people he cared about, protect this hard-won brotherhood, protect the maternal love from the Empress, protect the only warmth in this deep palace.

He closed his eyes, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. The sun was just right, time was quiet, with his elder brother by his side, with warmth accompanying him— this was the life he had wanted for nearly a thousand years. And he would use his remaining eight lives to protect this beauty.
