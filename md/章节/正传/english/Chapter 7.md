Year 25 of the Wanli Reign, late spring, the hour of the Pig (9-11 PM).

The candlelight in the Eastern Palace's side hall flickered in the evening breeze, casting dancing shadows on the scrolls and tea sets on the desk. Zhu Changlan had just come from Xian'an Palace, still carrying a faint scent of osmanthus blossoms—he had brewed new osmanthus wine in the evening and brought a small jar to let the Crown Prince taste it.

"Elder brother."

He lifted the curtain and entered, seeing the Crown Prince sitting at the desk, brows furrowed tightly, holding a memorial scroll, his expression grave unlike usual.

The Crown Prince looked up, seeing him come in, his tightly knit brows relaxed slightly, a gentle smile appearing on his face: "Ninth Brother, you're here."

He put down the memorial, pointing to the chair opposite, "Sit."

Zhu Changlan placed the osmanthus wine on the desk, sitting next to the Crown Prince, the air around him filled with the sandalwood of the hall and the ink scent of memorials. Looking at the lingering worry in the Crown Prince's eyes, he asked curiously: "Elder brother, you look troubled. Is there something bothering you in the court?"

The Crown Prince sighed, picking up the teacup on the table but not drinking, just rubbing the cup's rim: "Although Consort Zheng and the Third Brother have been thrown into the imperial prison, their followers remain. This morning in court, several old ministers jointly submitted a memorial, pleading for Consort Zheng and the Third Brother, saying 'for the sake of royal blood, lighten the punishment,' and implicitly accusing us brothers of 'mistreating our siblings.'"

Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold: "These old ministers must have accepted bribes from Consort Zheng's family, daring to plead so openly."

He paused, continuing, "Consort Zheng and the Third Brother colluded with the Black Bone Sect, plotting rebellion and assassinating you. Their crimes are heinous and deserve severe punishment. Where is the 'mistreatment'?"

"That's what I thought, but human hearts are complex."

The Crown Prince shook his head, "Consort Zheng's family is the Duke of Zhenguo's Mansion, which has operated in the court for many years with deeply rooted power. Those old ministers are either disciples of the Duke's Mansion or have accepted benefits, so they naturally speak for them. Father, although enraged, also顾忌 the Duke's Mansion's power and has been somewhat hesitant."

Zhu Changlan fell silent. Although he had lived for nearly a thousand years and seen countless battles in the demon world, he was not well-versed in human court intrigue. He knew the Crown Prince's difficulties—he had to maintain the royal family's dignity, eliminate traitors, and balance various forces. A single misstep could cause turmoil in the court.

"Moreover, there's another thing that worries me greatly."

The Crown Prince's voice lowered, his eyes filled with gravity, "Daoist Xuanqing sent a secret message yesterday, saying that the Black Bone Sect's leader didn't appear; Consort Zheng and the Third Brother were just pawns he used. The Black Bone Sect's real target is the spiritual vein source under Kunlun Mountain, which is connected to the dragon vein of the Great Ming. If the spiritual vein source is destroyed by the Black Bone Sect, the dragon vein will be damaged, and the Great Ming's foundation will be unstable."

Zhu Changlan's heart sank. The spiritual vein source was the place his clan had guarded for generations and the foundation of his cultivation. He never expected the Black Bone Sect's ambition to be so great—not only wanting to overthrow the court but also to destroy the spiritual vein source. "The spiritual vein source is protected by my clan's barrier. How could the Black Bone Sect's demons easily approach?"

"Although the barrier is strong, it can't withstand years of consumption."

The Crown Prince said, "Daoist Xuanqing said the Black Bone Sect has been secretly eroding the barrier these years, and now it has cracks. Furthermore, the Black Bone Sect leader has practiced an evil technique that requires absorbing the spiritual vein source's qi to break through his realm. He will stop at nothing to destroy the barrier and seize the spiritual vein source."

He paused, looking at Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of worry: "Ninth Brother, you are a Snow Spirit Cat, the guardian of the spiritual vein source. The Black Bone Sect leader will definitely target you, wanting to find a way to break the barrier from you. Although your cultivation has greatly increased and you have the help of Qingyun Temple disciples, the Black Bone Sect leader's strength is unfathomable. I'm really worried about your safety."

Zhu Changlan's heart warmed. The Crown Prince was worried not about his own throne but about his safety. He held the Crown Prince's hand, feeling the warmth from his palm, and said firmly: "Elder brother, don't worry. I am the guardian of the spiritual vein source and will never let the Black Bone Sect's plot succeed. Moreover, I have nine lives to protect me and the help of Qingyun Temple. Even if the Black Bone Sect leader personally takes action, I can handle it."

Looking at his determined eyes, the Crown Prince felt somewhat relieved but still frowned: "That's what you say, but I still can't rest easy. You are my only brother; I can't let you be in danger."

He paused, continuing, "I've secretly reinforced the defenses of the Eastern Palace and Xian'an Palace, and let Qingyun Temple disciples guard you day and night. Additionally, I'm secretly contacting garrisons everywhere. Once the Black Bone Sect moves, we'll immediately send troops to encircle them."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his heart full of gratitude. He knew the Crown Prince had paid too much for him and the Great Ming. "Elder brother, you should also be careful. Since the Black Bone Sect leader could use Consort Zheng and the Third Brother, he might also use other forces in the court to attack you."

"I know."

The Crown Prince smiled, patting his hand, "I will be extra cautious. And with you here, I have confidence."

He picked up the osmanthus wine on the desk, opened the lid, and a rich osmanthus fragrance filled the air, "Is this the new brew you made?"

"Yes."

Zhu Changlan nodded, a proud smile on his face, "I used this year's new osmanthus and added two spoonfuls of honey, sweeter than last year's."

The Crown Prince scooped a spoonful into his mouth. The sweetness slid down his throat, carrying the elegance of osmanthus, relaxing his tense nerves. "Delicious, richer than last year's."

He smiled, scooping another spoonful, "With your osmanthus wine, no matter how difficult things are, I feel I can endure them."

Looking at the Crown Prince's smile, Zhu Changlan felt warm in his heart. He knew the Crown Prince carried a heavy burden: court disputes, Black Bone Sect threats, and Father's hesitation, all weighing heavily on him. All he could do was stay by his side, share some of the burden, and let him feel a little warmth when he was tired.

I. Night Talk: Power Struggles and Protection, Brothers United

They drank osmanthus wine while chatting, the topic gradually shifting from court disputes and Black Bone Sect threats to past memories.

"I remember when you first entered the palace, you were timid, hiding from people and not daring to speak."

The Crown Prince smiled, his eyes full of reminiscence, "Once, you were feeding fish by the lake in the Imperial Garden and were bullied by some palace maids. You hid under a willow tree crying. I happened to pass by, taught those palace maids a lesson, and you pulled my sleeve and timidly called me 'elder brother.'"

Zhu Changlan's cheeks turned slightly red, somewhat embarrassed, "That was when I was a child. How do you remember it so clearly?"

"How could I forget."

The Crown Prince said, "From that moment, I knew you were the younger brother I needed to protect. Over the years, watching you grow from a timid child to today's capable prince who can even protect me, I feel both relieved and proud."

Looking at the Crown Prince, Zhu Changlan's eyes were full of sincerity: "Elder brother, thank you all these years. Without you, I would never have survived in this deep palace. You protected me, taught me to read and write, taught me how to behave, and gave me warmth and support."

The Crown Prince shook his head: "We are brothers; no thanks needed. You protect me, I protect you—it's only natural."

He paused, his tone becoming serious, "Ninth Brother, I know you have many secrets and that you don't belong to this deep palace. But I want you to know, no matter what your identity is, no matter where you come from, you are my brother Zhu Changluo, the Ninth Prince of the Great Ming. I will always protect you, even if one day you want to leave, I will support you."

Zhu Changlan's eyes reddened, tears almost falling. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, seen too much intrigue and betrayal, but never had anyone like the Crown Prince—who didn't ask about his past or secrets, just wholeheartedly protected him, treating him as family. "Elder brother, I won't leave. With you here, with the people I care about, this is my home."

The Crown Prince smiled, gently wiping the corner of his eye: "Good, having a home is good."

They talked for a long time, from poetry and songs to human life, from the snow scenes under Kunlun Mountain to the water towns of Jiangnan. Zhu Changlan talked about interesting things in the spiritual valley, the life-saving grace of the white-robed Daoist, and the kind people he met while wandering the human world; the Crown Prince talked about interesting things in the court, childhood hunting experiences with Father, and his expectations for the future.

The candle gradually burned out, and the sky outside began to lighten. Zhu Changlan yawned, his eyes full of sleepiness.

"Go back to sleep." The Crown Prince smiled, "You've been up all night; you must be tired."

Zhu Changlan nodded, rising to his feet: "Elder brother, you should rest early too, don't overwork yourself."

"Okay."

The Crown Prince nodded, watching him walk out of the side hall until his figure disappeared at the end of the corridor before turning back to the desk. He picked up the memorial on the table, his eyes once again firm—for the sake of his Ninth Brother, for the Great Ming, he must sweep away all obstacles and protect this hard-won peace.

II. Undercurrents: Counterattacks of Remaining Forces

When Zhu Changlan returned to Xian'an Palace, it was already dawn. Xiaoluzi had long prepared washing supplies and breakfast, greeting him hurriedly when he saw him: "Your Highness, you're back. You stayed up all night; hurry and wash up, eat something, then sleep well."

Zhu Changlan nodded, washed up, and sat at the table to eat. The breakfast was his favorite crab soup dumplings and almond paste, but he had no appetite, his mind constantly thinking about the Crown Prince's worries. He knew the Crown Prince's concerns weren't unfounded—Consort Zheng and the Third Prince's remaining forces, as well as the Black Bone Sect's threats, were like swords hanging over their heads, ready to fall at any moment.

After eating, Zhu Changlan lay on the couch but couldn't sleep. He circulated his demon power, sensing the aura in the palace. Sure enough, he detected several unusual auras with faint black qi, lurking around the Eastern Palace and Xian'an Palace—remnants of the Black Bone Sect and Consort Zheng's followers.

"It seems they won't give up easily."

Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold. He got up, walked to the window, looking at the osmanthus tree in the courtyard, thinking about countermeasures. Although Consort Zheng and the Third Prince had been thrown into the imperial prison, their followers remained, and the Black Bone Sect was secretly lying in wait. Completely eliminating these threats wouldn't be easy.

He was thinking when Daoist Xuanchen, a disciple of Qingyun Temple, walked in, bowing and saluting: "Greetings to the Ninth Prince."

"Daoist Xuanchen, no need for formalities." Zhu Changlan said, "You've come to see me—do you have something to report?"

"Returning to Your Highness,"

Daoist Xuanchen said, "We've detected remnants of the Black Bone Sect and Consort Zheng's followers lurking in the palace, seemingly plotting something. The abbot asked us to remind Your Highness to be cautious."

"I've already detected them."

Zhu Changlan nodded, "These people must want to rescue Consort Zheng and the Third Prince or attack me and the Crown Prince."

"Your Highness is right."

Daoist Xuanchen said, "We've strengthened the defenses of the Eastern Palace and Xian'an Palace. If they make a move, we'll act immediately."

"Good."

Zhu Changlan nodded, "Thank you for your hard work. Also, please inform Daoist Xuanqing to pay more attention to the Black Bone Sect leader's movements. According to the Crown Prince, the Black Bone Sect leader's target is the spiritual vein source under Kunlun Mountain. We can't be careless."

"Your Highness can rest assured. The abbot has already sent people to Kunlun Mountain to strengthen the barrier and monitor the Black Bone Sect's movements."

Daoist Xuanchen said.

Zhu Changlan breathed a sigh of relief: "Thank you, Abbot and Daoist."

Daoist Xuanchen bowed and left. Watching his back, Zhu Changlan felt more at ease. With Qingyun Temple's help and the Crown Prince's protection, he believed they could handle any difficulties together.

But he didn't expect danger to come so quickly.

At noon that day, the Crown Prince was discussing state affairs with the Emperor in the Imperial Study when several black-clad men burst in, holding sharp blades, charging straight at the Emperor and Crown Prince. These black-clad men were all followers of Consort Zheng, with strong martial arts skills and ruthless attacks.

"Protect the Emperor!" The Crown Prince shouted, standing in front of the Emperor, fighting with the black-clad men.

The Imperial Study's guards rushed in, fighting with the black-clad men. But these black-clad men were unusually powerful, and the guards gradually fell into a disadvantage. Although the Crown Prince had practiced martial arts, he gradually became exhausted, with a deep gash on his arm.

"Elder brother!"

Zhu Changlan's voice came. He had sensed the disturbance in the Imperial Study and immediately rushed over with Qingyun Temple disciples.

Zhu Changlan charged into the Imperial Study, seeing the Crown Prince injured, his eyes instantly turning cold. He gripped the dagger at his waist, his cat's-eye stone glowing with blue light, golden demon power surging, straight at one of the black-clad men.

"Puchi"—the dagger pierced the black-clad man's chest. The black-clad man screamed and fell to the ground.

The other black-clad men, seeing this, roared and simultaneously charged at Zhu Changlan. Qingyun Temple disciples immediately cast spells, golden talismans flying in the air, attacking the black-clad men.

Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, like a cat穿梭ing between the black-clad men, his dagger moving like a whirlwind, each swing taking a black-clad man's life. The Crown Prince also seized the opportunity to counterattack, joining forces with the guards to quickly eliminate the remaining black-clad men.

The Imperial Study was in chaos, with black-clad men's bodies lying everywhere, blood red staining the ground. The Emperor's face was pale, clearly frightened. The Crown Prince's arm was still bleeding, his face also pale.

"Elder brother, how are you?" Zhu Changlan hurried to the Crown Prince's side, his voice full of anxiety.

"I'm fine." The Crown Prince shook his head, looking at the Emperor, "Father, are you alright?"

The Emperor regained his composure, waving his hand: "I'm fine. Thanks to both of you brothers, otherwise, I wouldn't have escaped this disaster today."

He looked at the bodies on the ground, his eyes full of anger, "These traitors dare to break into the Imperial Study and assassinate me and the Crown Prince—they're truly audacious!"

"Father, these people are all followers of Consort Zheng."

The Crown Prince said, "They're unwilling to accept Consort Zheng and the Third Brother being thrown into the imperial prison, wanting to assassinate you and me to create chaos."

The Emperor was furious: "Good! Good! What a Duke of Zhenguo's Mansion! What a Consort Zheng! I won't spare them!"

He shouted to the outside, "Come! Pass my order: execute the entire Duke of Zhenguo's Mansion, and give Consort Zheng and the Third Prince death in the imperial prison!"

"Yes!" The guards accepted the order and left.

Looking at the Emperor's furious appearance, Zhu Changlan breathed a sigh of relief. Consort Zheng and the Third Prince's remaining forces would finally be completely eliminated.

III. Worries: Crisis of the Spiritual Vein, Uncertain Future

After dealing with Consort Zheng's followers, the palace temporarily returned to calm. The Crown Prince's wound gradually healed under the imperial physician's treatment. But both Zhu Changlan and the Crown Prince knew this was only temporary calm—the Black Bone Sect's threat still existed.

That day, Zhu Changlan was meditating in Xian'an Palace's courtyard when Daoist Xuanqing suddenly visited. In Xian'an Palace's courtyard, a gentle breeze blew, rustling the osmanthus tree's leaves and bringing a faint fragrance. Zhu Changlan sat at a stone table, a pot of freshly brewed tea in front of him, steam curling upward, interweaving with his surrounding spiritual energy to form a faint light screen. Beside the old well in the east of the courtyard, Xiaoluzi was cleaning tea sets. When he saw Daoist Xuanqing, he quickly stood up and saluted.

"Daoist, why have you come?" Zhu Changlan quickly rose, bowing and saluting.

"Xuanyu, something has happened."

Daoist Xuanqing's face was grave, "The barrier of Kunlun Mountain has been broken by the Black Bone Sect leader."

Zhu Changlan's face instantly turned pale: "What? How could the barrier be broken?"

"The Black Bone Sect leader has practiced an extremely evil technique, greatly increasing his strength."

Daoist Xuanqing said, "He led a large number of demons to attack the barrier. Our disciples fought to the death but couldn't hold it. Now, the Black Bone Sect's demons have invaded the spiritual vein source, greedily absorbing the spiritual vein's qi."

Zhu Changlan's body trembled slightly. The spiritual vein source was the root of his clan and his own foundation. Now that the spiritual vein source was violated, how could he not be anxious. "Daoist, what should we do now?"

"If the spiritual vein source's qi is completely absorbed, not only will all living beings under Kunlun Mountain suffer, but the Great Ming's dragon vein will also be damaged, causing chaos in the world and suffering for the people."

Daoist Xuanqing said, "We must go to Kunlun Mountain immediately to stop the Black Bone Sect leader."

"Okay." Zhu Changlan nodded firmly, "I'll go with you."

"No."

The Crown Prince's voice came. He had arrived at Xian'an Palace at some point, his face pale as he looked at Zhu Changlan, "Ninth Brother, you can't go. The Black Bone Sect leader's strength is unfathomable; it's too dangerous for you to go."

"Elder brother, the spiritual vein source is my root—I can't watch it be destroyed by the Black Bone Sect."

Zhu Changlan said, "Moreover, the spiritual vein source is connected to the Great Ming's dragon vein. If the spiritual vein source is destroyed, the Great Ming will be unstable. I must go."

"But......" The Crown Prince wanted to say more but was interrupted by Zhu Changlan.

"Elder brother, I've made up my mind."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince, his eyes full of determination, "I am a Snow Spirit Cat, the guardian of the spiritual vein source. This is my responsibility. Don't worry; I'll protect myself and definitely come back safely."

Looking at his determined eyes, the Crown Prince knew he couldn't stop him. He sighed, his eyes full of worry: "Okay, I'll agree. But you must promise me to protect yourself—no matter what danger you encounter, you must come back alive."

"I will." Zhu Changlan nodded.

The Crown Prince took a brocade box from his sleeve, handing it to Zhu Changlan: "Inside is the protective jade pendant Father gave me, which can withstand three fatal attacks. Take it with you; it might be useful in danger."

He paused, then handed him a small porcelain bottle, "Inside is a special healing medicine made by Imperial Physician Li, very effective. Take it with you."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade box and porcelain bottle, carefully putting them away: "Thank you, Elder brother."

"I've already prepared carriages, travel expenses, and Qingyun Temple disciples to accompany you."

The Crown Prince said, "I'll stay in the capital to handle court affairs and provide support. If you encounter danger, immediately send someone back to inform me, and I'll send troops to support you."

"Okay." Zhu Changlan nodded, his heart full of gratitude.

Daoist Xuanqing said, "Your Highness, please rest assured. We will protect the Ninth Prince's safety. Moreover, righteous cultivators from all places have heard the news and are coming to help. We will join forces to deal with the Black Bone Sect leader."

The Crown Prince nodded, looking at Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of reluctance: "Ninth Brother, be careful on your journey, go and return soon. I'll wait for you in the capital."

"Elder brother, take care." Zhu Changlan bowed, then turned and followed Daoist Xuanqing out of the palace.

The carriage slowly left the capital. Zhu Changlan sat in the carriage, lifting the curtain to watch the capital's outline gradually fade away, his heart full of reluctance. He knew this journey would be full of danger, but he had no fear—for the sake of protecting the spiritual vein source, for the Great Ming, for the Crown Prince, he must forge ahead.

IV. Kunlun Battlefield: Black Wind Rolling Snow, Demon Flames Raging

(1) Arrival: Spiritual Vein Weeping Blood, Barrier Collapsing

Seven days later, Zhu Changlan and his group arrived at the foot of Kunlun Mountain.

The scenery outside the carriage window was no longer as beautiful as he remembered— the Kunlun main peak, which was always covered in snow, was now shrouded in a thick layer of black qi, like a huge piece of black jade pressing against the sky. The spiritual valley at the foot of the mountain was no longer lush with vegetation; the streams had frozen into ice, and the bodies of fish and shrimp could be faintly seen under the ice, emitting a faint black qi. The air was filled with a strong smell of blood and evil qi, making people's throats tight.

"The barrier collapsed on the west side of the main peak." Daoist Xuanqing pointed to the distant mountains, his voice grave.

Zhu Changlan followed his finger, seeing that on the west side of the main peak, the barrier that should have been glowing with faint golden spiritual energy now looked like broken glass, covered with spiderweb-like cracks. Black qi surged out from the cracks, dyeing half the sky ink-black. From the direction of the spiritual vein source came a low rumble, like the earth weeping.

"Let's hurry."

Zhu Changlan gripped the dagger at his waist, his cat's-eye stone glowing faintly in the black qi, "The spiritual vein's qi is flowing away quickly."

The group changed to horses, galloping up the frozen mountain road. The closer they got to the main peak, the thicker the black qi became. From time to time, they could see the bodies of Qingyun Temple disciples and Black Bone Sect demons on the roadside. Some disciples were charred all over, apparently burned to death by evil fire; others were corroded by black qi, their bodies twisted and deformed, dying in agony.

Zhu Changlan's heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand. These disciples had died to protect the spiritual vein source. Their sacrifice only strengthened his determination to eliminate the Black Bone Sect leader.

When they arrived at the spiritual vein source, the scene before them shocked everyone.

The spiritual vein source was a huge valley with a golden spiritual spring flowing at the bottom. The spring eye, which should have been surrounded by rich spiritual energy, was now wrapped in black qi. Hundreds of Black Bone Sect demons surrounded the spring eye, sitting cross-legged, greedily absorbing the spiritual spring's qi. Their bodies continued to expand, their auras growing stronger and stronger.

In the center of the valley, a man in a black robe stood with his back to them, floating above the spiritual spring. He was tall, with strange black patterns embroidered on his black robe, and black qi swirling around him, almost solidifying. The golden spiritual energy of the spring was continuously being sucked into his body, his aura becoming more and more terrifying, even the surrounding space slightly distorted.

"Black Bone Sect leader!" Daoist Xuanqing shouted, gripping his whisk.

The black-robed man slowly turned around, revealing a pale face. His eyes were pure black, without whites, emitting a cold, evil light. The corners of his mouth curled into a cruel smile: "Xuanqing, you've come just in time. After I absorb all the spiritual vein source's qi and break through my realm, I'll send you to the afterlife first."

His gaze swept over Zhu Changlan, his pupils constricting slightly: "A Snow Spirit Cat? I didn't expect the guardian of the spiritual vein source is still alive."

Zhu Changlan's eyes were cold, golden demon power surging around him: "Black Bone Sect leader, you've massacred living beings and destroyed the spiritual vein. Today, I'll act on behalf of heaven and eliminate you!"

"Act on behalf of heaven?"

The leader sneered, black qi erupting violently, "This world is about the strong preying on the weak. The spiritual vein source's qi should belong to the strong. You little cat demon dare to be so arrogant in front of me?"

Before he finished speaking, the leader raised his hand, and several black demon whips emerged from the black qi, with ear-piercing破空 sounds, straight at Zhu Changlan. The demon whips were covered with barbs, glowing with a sickly green light, clearly poisoned.

"Be careful!" Daoist Xuanqing quickly swung his whisk, golden spiritual energy forming a barrier to block the demon whips.

"Bang"—a loud noise. The golden barrier was shattered by the demon whips. Daoist Xuanqing stepped back several steps, a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.

"Abbot!" The Qingyun Temple disciples exclaimed,纷纷 taking out talismans to form a formation.

"Useless."

The leader sneered, waving his black robe, and more demon whips emerged, like a black net covering everyone. At the same time, the Black Bone Sect demons who had been absorbing spiritual energy all stood up, roaring and charging forward.

"Xuanchen, take the disciples to deal with the demons!" Daoist Xuanqing shouted, "Xuanyu, let's join forces to deal with the leader!"

"Okay!"

Zhu Changlan responded, his figure flashing like a golden afterimage, charging at the leader. The cat's-eye stone on his dagger erupted with a dazzling blue light, golden demon power intertwining with the blue light to form a sharp sword qi.

The leader dodged sideways, his black robe flicking, sending a black demon fire at Zhu Changlan. When the demon fire landed, it burst into raging black flames, burning the ground and making a "滋滋" sound. Even the stones were melted by the fire.

Zhu Changlan moved flexibly,穿梭ing through the black flames, his dagger moving like a whirlwind, continuously attacking the leader. Daoist Xuanqing also attacked simultaneously, his whisk挥洒, golden talismans raining down, attacking the leader's vital points.

The leader's strength was far beyond their imagination. He blocked their joint attack with just one person, black qi constantly surging, his moves ruthless, each strike aiming to kill.

"Puchi"

Zhu Changlan's shoulder was swept by a demon whip. His brocade robe was instantly torn, blood gushing out. Black qi invaded his body along the wound, like countless ice needles stabbing his meridians.

"Ninth Prince!"

Daoist Xuanchen exclaimed, wanting to come to his aid but was entangled by several powerful demons, unable to break free.

Zhu Changlan grunted, circulating his demon power to forcefully suppress the black qi in his body, then stabbed his dagger at the leader's eyebrow again.

The leader sneered, grabbing the dagger with his hand. Black qi spread along the dagger, trying to corrode Zhu Changlan's arm. "Little cat demon, do you dare to hurt me?"

Zhu Changlan's eyes turned sharp. His demon power suddenly surged, and golden demon power poured into the leader's palm along the dagger. The leader's face changed—he didn't expect Zhu Changlan's demon power to be so pure. He quickly let go of his hand and stepped back several steps.

"Your demon power is stronger than I thought."

The leader's eyes turned cold, "But that's all."

He formed a seal with his hands, the black patterns on his black robe lighting up. Thick black qi poured out from his body, condensing into a huge black demon claw, slapping towards Zhu Changlan. The demon claw covered the sky, with a destructive momentum, even the surrounding spiritual energy was pulled into chaos.

"Xuanyu, dodge quickly!"

Daoist Xuanqing exclaimed, wanting to rush over to block but was thrown back by the black qi emitted by the leader.

Zhu Changlan knew he couldn't dodge. He gripped his dagger tightly, pouring all his demon power into the dagger. The blue light of the cat's-eye stone merged with the golden demon power, forming a huge golden shield.

"Bang------"

The demon claw slammed heavily onto the shield, making a deafening noise. The golden shield trembled violently, covered with countless cracks. Zhu Changlan's mouth overflowed with blood, his body sent flying by the huge impact, landing heavily on the ground. His chest heaved violently, his qi and blood churning.

The shield shattered, and the black demon claw, with remaining force, slapped towards Zhu Changlan again.

At this critical moment, the protective jade pendant at Zhu Changlan's waist suddenly lit up, a golden light enveloping him. The demon claw slapped onto the light,硬生生 blocked back.

"Father's protective jade pendant!" Zhu Changlan was overjoyed, quickly taking the opportunity to get up and circulate his demon power to heal.

The leader looked at the golden light, his eyes becoming even colder: "A royal protective jade pendant? It has some tricks. But it can only protect you once!"

He raised his hand again, black qi condensing into several black spears, shooting towards Zhu Changlan. The spears made ear-piercing 破空 sounds, moving extremely fast.

A phantom of a tail appeared behind Zhu Changlan. His fluffy white tail, filled with golden demon power, was like a fan, sweeping away most of the spears. But one spear still broke through the defense, stabbing into his abdomen.

"Puchi"

The spear pierced his abdomen, blood instantly dyeing his robe red. Zhu Changlan grunted, his face pale as paper, his demon power instantly chaotic.

"Ninth Prince!"

Daoist Xuanqing's eyes cracked with anger, rushing at the leader regardless of his safety. Golden spiritual energy surged from his whisk, "I'll fight you to the death!"

The leader sneered, waving his hand lightly, a black qi sending Daoist Xuanqing flying. Daoist Xuanqing landed heavily, spitting out a large mouthful of blood, struggling to get up but found his meridians sealed by black qi, unable to move.

"Abbot!" The Qingyun Temple disciples were anxious but were tightly entangled by demons, powerless to help.

The leader walked slowly towards Zhu Changlan, his eyes cold: "Snow Spirit Cat, your nine lives will end here today. Hand over your spiritual source, and I'll give you a quick death."

Zhu Changlan struggled to stand up, blood at the corner of his mouth, but his eyes still firm: "Dream on about getting my spiritual source!"

He suddenly circulated all the remaining demon power in his body, maximizing the power of the cat's-eye stone. The blue light of the cat's-eye stone and the golden demon power merged, forming a huge cat-shaped phantom behind him, "Spiritual vein protection, all demons retreat!"

The cat-shaped phantom let out a deafening roar, pouncing towards the leader. Wherever the phantom passed, black qi dissipated one after another. The demons let out screams, their bodies torn apart by the phantom's power.

The leader's face changed greatly, not expecting Zhu Changlan to erupt with such powerful force. He quickly circulated black qi, condensing into a black barrier.

"Bang------"

The cat-shaped phantom crashed heavily into the barrier. The black barrier instantly covered with cracks. The leader spat out a large mouthful of black blood, his body stepping back several steps, his face becoming even paler.

Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, his figure flashing to the leader's front. The dagger, filled with golden demon power and blue light, stabbed fiercely into the leader's heart.

The leader wanted to dodge but was entangled by the cat-shaped phantom, unable to move. "Puchi"—the dagger accurately stabbed into his heart.

Golden demon power poured into the leader's body along the dagger, destroying his meridians and spiritual consciousness. The leader let out a shrill scream, his body twisting continuously. Black qi poured out from his body, gradually dissipating.

"No------ I'm not willing!"

The leader's voice was full of venom, "I haven't broken through my realm yet, I haven't ruled the world------"

His body gradually turned into black qi but didn't completely dissipate. A faint black shadow flew out from the black qi, fleeing towards the outside of the valley.

"Want to run!" Zhu Changlan's eyes turned sharp, wanting to chase but collapsed to the ground due to exhausting all his demon power.

"Ninth Prince!" Daoist Xuanchen broke free from the demons, quickly rushing over to support him.

Zhu Changlan pointed at the black shadow: "Don't let him get away...... he's not completely dead......"

Daoist Xuanqing struggled to get up, circulating his remaining spiritual energy to shoot a golden talisman at the black shadow. The talisman caught up with the shadow, making a loud noise. The shadow was hit, becoming even fainter, but still stubbornly fled into the depths of the Kunlun Mountains, eventually disappearing.

"We couldn't kill him completely." Daoist Xuanqing sighed, his face full of regret.

Zhu Changlan shook his head, his voice weak: "It's okay...... he's severely injured...... he won't be able to cause trouble...... for a short time......"

After saying this, his vision went black and he fainted. His demon power was completely exhausted, one life already lost, his body becoming extremely weak.

(2) Aftermath: Spiritual Vein Recovery, Remnants Not Eliminated

After Zhu Changlan fainted, Daoist Xuanqing immediately had him carried to a safe place and treated him with Qingyun Temple's healing elixir. At the same time, Qingyun Temple disciples and righteous cultivators from all places joined forces to clean up the remaining demons in the valley.

The black qi in the spiritual vein source gradually dissipated, the golden spiritual spring flowed again, and spiritual energy slowly recovered. The snow on Kunlun Mountain began to melt, plants sprouted new shoots, and the spiritual valley gradually restored its former vitality.

Three days later, Zhu Changlan slowly woke up.

He lay in a temporary tent, his wounds already bandaged, and the black qi in his body cleared, but his demon power was still weak, his body light and powerless.

"Ninth Prince, you're awake!" Daoist Xuanchen, who was guarding him, was overjoyed.

Zhu Changlan nodded, his voice hoarse: "How's the spiritual vein?"

"The spiritual vein's qi is recovering, no major issues."

Daoist Xuanchen said, "The remaining demons have been cleaned up, but...... the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul escaped, which might leave hidden dangers."

Zhu Changlan's eyes darkened: "His remnant soul...... is severely damaged...... he can't...... cause trouble in a short time...... but we should still be careful......"

He paused, continuing, "Please ask the Daoist...... to send a message to my elder brother...... that the spiritual vein source is safe...... I'm not in danger...... so he doesn't have to worry......"

"Okay, I'll do it right away." Daoist Xuanchen bowed and left.

Zhu Changlan lay in the tent, looking at the canvas roof, images of the Crown Prince appearing in his mind. He wondered if the Crown Prince was well in the capital, if there were any changes in the court. What he wanted most now was to quickly recover his demon power, return to the capital, and be by the Crown Prince's side.

Daoist Xuanqing walked in, holding a bowl of healing medicine: "Xuanyu, drink this medicine. It's brewed with spiritual vein spring water and thousand-year-old healing herbs, which can help you recover your demon power."

Zhu Changlan took the medicine bowl, drinking it all in one gulp. The medicine was bitter but carried a rich spiritual energy, sliding down his throat and nourishing his damaged meridians.

"Thank you, Daoist." Zhu Changlan said.

"No need to thank me."

Daoist Xuanqing said, "You sacrificed one life and exhausted your thousand-year demon power to protect the spiritual vein source. This kindness, Qingyun Temple will never forget."

Zhu Changlan shook his head: "Protecting the spiritual vein source...... is my responsibility......"

They talked for a while longer. Daoist Xuanqing explained some methods to recover demon power, then got up and left, letting him rest well.

Zhu Changlan closed his eyes, circulating the method Daoist Xuanqing taught him, absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy. The spiritual vein source's spiritual energy was rich and pure, nourishing his body and demon power. He could feel his demon power slowly recovering, but it would take time to return to its peak.

V. Capital Concerns: The Crown Prince's Sleepless Night

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Palace of the capital.

The Crown Prince received the message from Daoist Xuanchen, learning that the spiritual vein source was safe and Zhu Changlan was not in danger, which made him somewhat relieved. But when he learned that Zhu Changlan had lost one life and exhausted his thousand-year demon power, his heart was full of worry and distress.

"Ninth Brother, why are you so foolish."

The Crown Prince sat in the side hall, looking at the osmanthus wine Zhu Changlan had given him, his eyes reddening, "You clearly didn't have to fight so hard."

He picked up the osmanthus wine, opened the lid, and a rich osmanthus fragrance filled the air, but it was no longer as sweet as before. He thought of the night they talked in the Eastern Palace, of Zhu Changlan's proud smile when brewing osmanthus wine, of his determined eyes before departure—his heart was full of concern.

That night, the Crown Prince stayed awake all night. He sat in the side hall, looking at the candlelight, silently praying for Zhu Changlan, hoping he would recover soon and return safely.

Early the next morning, after handling court affairs, the Crown Prince immediately had carriages prepared, wanting to go to Kunlun Mountain to see Zhu Changlan. But just as he reached the palace gate, he was stopped by his ministers.

"Your Highness, you can't leave the capital."

The Prime Minister bowed, "The court has just stabilized, and the Black Bone Sect's remnants haven't been eliminated. If you leave, there might be changes in the capital."

"Yes, Your Highness."

Other ministers also echoed, "The Ninth Prince has his own destiny and will surely return safely. As the Crown Prince, you should prioritize the overall situation."

Looking at the ministers' sincere eyes, the Crown Prince was filled with helplessness. He knew the ministers were right—he couldn't leave the capital. But he was truly worried about Zhu Changlan and wanted to fly to his side immediately to take care of him and stay with him.

"I know." The Crown Prince sighed, turning back to the Eastern Palace, "You may leave."

Returning to the Eastern Palace, the Crown Prince had a large amount of healing elixir and tonics prepared, sending them to Kunlun Mountain with Daoist Xuanchen's disciples, ensuring Zhu Changlan received the best treatment. He also personally wrote a letter, urging Zhu Changlan to rest well, not to rush to recover his demon power, and to return to the capital slowly when his body improved. He would wait for him in the capital forever.

VI. Return: Warmth Lasting, Peaceful Years

A month later, Zhu Changlan finally returned to the capital.

The Crown Prince personally went to the palace gate to welcome him. Seeing Zhu Changlan step down from the carriage, his face still pale but full of energy, the Crown Prince's heart was full of excitement.

"Ninth Brother!" The Crown Prince quickly stepped forward, embracing him tightly.

"Elder brother." Zhu Changlan also hugged him tightly, his voice full of longing.

"It's good to be back, it's good to be back."

The Crown Prince released him, looking him over carefully, "How's your body? How's your demon power recovering?"

"Much better."

Zhu Changlan smiled, "Daoist Xuanqing gave me many healing elixirs, and my demon power has recovered more than half."

The Crown Prince nodded, holding his hand and walking towards the Eastern Palace, "Quick, come with me. I had the kitchen prepare your favorite crab soup dumplings and almond paste."

Zhu Changlan smiled and nodded, following the Crown Prince into the Eastern Palace. In the Eastern Palace's courtyard, osmanthus flowers were in bloom, their fragrance rich. On the table were his favorite dishes and a pot of warm osmanthus wine.

They sat down, and the Crown Prince poured him a cup of osmanthus wine, "Let's toast to your safe return."

Zhu Changlan raised his cup, clinking it with the Crown Prince's, taking a small sip: "Cheers."

The sweetness of the osmanthus wine spread in his mouth, like a warm current, warming his heart. He looked at the Crown Prince's gentle smile, listening to the insects in the courtyard, feeling the warmth around him—his heart was filled with unprecedented peace.

"Elder brother, although the Black Bone Sect leader wasn't completely killed, he's severely injured and won't cause trouble in a short time. The spiritual vein source has also recovered, and the Great Ming is finally at peace."

Zhu Changlan said.

"Yes, peace at last."

The Crown Prince smiled, "All of this is thanks to you. Without you, we could never have defeated the Black Bone Sect leader."

"This is what I should do."

Zhu Changlan said, "Protecting the spiritual vein source, protecting the Great Ming, protecting you—these are all my responsibilities."

The Crown Prince looked at him, his eyes full of tenderness, "Ninth Brother, from now on, there will be no more wars, no more dangers. We can study, enjoy flowers, and drink osmanthus wine together in the Eastern Palace, living the life we want."

Zhu Changlan nodded, a happy smile on his face. He knew that the most precious things in this world weren't eternal cultivation or supreme power, but family around him, sincere friendship, and this warmth guarded through storms.

The sun set, its golden light洒ing over the Eastern Palace courtyard, stretching their shadows long. The osmanthus fragrance filled the air, interweaving with the sweetness of the osmanthus wine, forming the most gentle melody.

Zhu Changlan knew that the days ahead would be full of sunshine and warmth. He would be with the Crown Prince, guarding the Great Ming, this hard-won peace, and this deep brotherly bond forever. And the escaped remnant soul of the Black Bone Sect leader, like a tiny thorn, lurked in the dark, planting a hint of suspense for the future—would he make a comeback? When would the next crisis come?
