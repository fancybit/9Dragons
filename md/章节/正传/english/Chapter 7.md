The 25th year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty, late spring, the hour of the Pig (9-11 PM).

The candlelight in the Eastern Palace's side hall flickered in the evening breeze, casting shifting shadows on the scrolls and tea set on the table. Zhu Changlan had just come from Tranquility Peace Palace, carrying a faint scent of osmanthus—he had brewed a new batch of osmanthus wine that evening and brought a small jar to share with the Crown Prince.

"Brother."

He lifted the curtain and entered, seeing the Crown Prince sitting at the desk, brows furrowed, holding a memorial with a grave expression unlike his usual self.

The Crown Prince looked up, his tense brows relaxing slightly as a gentle smile appeared on his face: "Ninth Brother, you're here."
He put down the memorial, gesturing to the chair opposite: "Sit."

Zhu Changlan placed the osmanthus wine on the desk and sat beside the Crown Prince, the air around him filled with the scent of sandalwood from the hall and ink from the memorials. Seeing the lingering worry in the Crown Prince's eyes, he asked curiously: "Brother, you look troubled. Is there something worrying you in the court?"

The Crown Prince sighed, picked up his tea cup without drinking, just rubbing the cup wall: "Although Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince have been imprisoned, their remaining followers are still active. This morning, several old ministers jointly submitted a memorial, pleading for leniency, saying 'considering their royal blood, treat them lightly,' and even implicitly accusing us brothers of 'mistreating our kin.'"

Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold: "These old ministers must have accepted bribes from Concubine Zheng's family. That's why they dare to plead for them so openly."
He paused, continuing: "Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince colluded with the Black Bone Sect, plotting rebellion and assassinating you—their crimes are heinous, and they deserve severe punishment. Where is the 'mistreatment'?"

"That's what I think, but human hearts are complicated." 
The Crown Prince shook his head: "Concubine Zheng's family is the Duke of Zhenguo, with deep-rooted power in the court. Those old ministers are either disciples of the Duke of Zhenguo or have accepted their bribes, so they naturally speak up for them. Although Father is furious, he is also wary of the Duke of Zhenguo's power and is hesitant."

Zhu Changlan fell silent. Though he had lived for nearly a thousand years and seen countless battles in the demon world, he was not well-versed in the court politics of the human world. He understood the Crown Prince's difficulties—

He had to maintain royal dignity, eliminate treacherous officials, and balance various forces. A single misstep could trigger court unrest.

"Moreover, there's something else that worries me greatly." 
The Crown Prince's voice lowered, his eyes filled with solemnity: "Taoist Xuan Qing sent a secret letter yesterday, saying that the leader of the Black Bone Sect has not appeared—Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince were just pawns he used. The Black Bone Sect's true target is the Spirit Vein Source at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, which is connected to the dragon vein of our Great Ming. If the Spirit Vein Source is destroyed by the Black Bone Sect, the dragon vein will be damaged, and the Great Ming will be in turmoil."

Zhu Changlan's heart sank. The Spirit Vein Source was the place his clan had guarded for generations, and the foundation of his cultivation. He never imagined that the Black Bone Sect's ambition was so great—not only did they want to overthrow the court, but they also wanted to destroy the Spirit Vein Source. "The Spirit Vein Source is protected by the clan's barrier. How could the demon creatures of the Black Bone Sect easily approach?"

"The barrier is strong, but it cannot withstand years of erosion." 
The Crown Prince said: "Taoist Xuan Qing says that the Black Bone Sect has been secretly eroding the barrier all these years, and now the barrier has developed cracks. Moreover, the leader of the Black Bone Sect has cultivated an evil technique that requires absorbing the spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein Source to break through his realm. He will do whatever it takes to destroy the barrier and seize the Spirit Vein Source."

He paused, looking at Zhu Changlan with worry in his eyes: "Ninth Brother, you are a Snow Spirit Cat, the guardian of the Spirit Vein Source. The leader of the Black Bone Sect will definitely target you, trying to find a way to break the barrier from you. Although your cultivation has greatly increased and you have the disciples of Qingyun Temple to assist you, the leader's strength is unfathomable. I'm really worried about your safety."

Zhu Changlan felt a warm current in his heart—the Crown Prince was not worried about his own throne, but about his safety. He held the Crown Prince's hand, feeling the warmth from his palm, and said firmly: "Brother, rest assured. I am the guardian of the Spirit Vein Source, and I will never let the Black Bone Sect's scheme succeed. Moreover, I have nine lives and the help of Qingyun Temple's disciples. Even if the Black Bone Sect leader personally attacks, I can handle it."

The Crown Prince looked at his firm gaze, feeling slightly more at ease, but his brows remained furrowed: "That's what you say, but I still can't rest easy. You are my only brother; I can't let you be in danger."
He paused, continuing: "I've secretly reinforced the defenses of the Eastern Palace and Tranquility Peace Palace, and I've also had Qingyun Temple disciples guard you day and night. Additionally, I'm secretly contacting garrisons from various places. If the Black Bone Sect makes any moves, we will immediately send troops to suppress them."

Zhu Changlan nodded, filled with gratitude. He knew that the Crown Prince had sacrificed so much for him and for the Great Ming. "Brother, you should also be careful. Since the Black Bone Sect leader can use Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince, he might also use other forces in the court to target you."

"I know." 
The Crown Prince smiled, patting the back of his hand: "I'll be more careful. With you by my side, I feel more confident."
He picked up the osmanthus wine on the desk, opening the lid—rich osmanthus fragrance filled the air: "Is this your new brew?"

"Yes." 
Zhu Changlan nodded, a proud smile on his face: "I used this year's new osmanthus flowers and added two spoons of honey. It's sweeter than last year's."

The Crown Prince scooped a spoonful into his mouth, the sweet fragrance sliding down his throat with the elegance of osmanthus, relaxing his tense nerves. "It's delicious, richer than last year's."
He smiled, scooping another spoonful: "With your osmanthus wine, no matter how difficult things are, I feel I can bear them."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince's smile, feeling warm in his heart. He knew the Crown Prince carried a heavy burden—court conflicts, the threat of the Black Bone Sect, and the Emperor's hesitation, all weighing heavily on him. All he could do was stay by his side, share his burden, and let him feel a hint of warmth when he was tired.

## Part One: Late-Night Talk—Power and Protection, Brothers United

As they drank osmanthus wine and chatted, their conversation gradually shifted from court conflicts and the threat of the Black Bone Sect to past memories.

"I still remember when you first entered the palace, you were timid, hiding from people and not daring to speak." 
The Crown Prince said with a smile, his eyes full of nostalgia: "Once, you were feeding fish by the lake in the Imperial Garden and were bullied by a few palace maids, hiding under a willow tree crying. I happened to pass by, taught those palace maids a lesson, and you pulled my sleeve, timidly calling me 'Brother.'"

Zhu Changlan's cheeks flushed slightly, embarrassed: "That was when I was a child. How do you remember it so clearly?"

"How could I forget?" 
The Crown Prince said: "From that moment on, I felt you were the younger brother I needed to protect. Over these years, watching you grow from a timid child to a capable prince who can protect me, I feel both relieved and proud."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince with sincere eyes: "Brother, thank you all these years. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have survived in this deep palace. You protected me, taught me to read and write, taught me how to behave, and gave me warmth and support."

The Crown Prince shook his head: "We are brothers; there's no need for thanks. You protecting me and me protecting you is only natural."
He paused, his tone becoming serious: "Ninth Brother, I know you have many secrets, and I know you don't belong to this deep palace. But I want you to know that no matter what your identity is, no matter where you come from, you are my brother, Zhu Changluo's brother, the Ninth Prince of the Great Ming. I will always protect you. Even if one day you want to leave here, I will support you."

Zhu Changlan's eyes turned red, tears nearly falling. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, seen too much treachery and betrayal, but never had anyone like the Crown Prince—someone who didn't ask about his past, didn't ask about his secrets, but just wanted to protect him, treating him as his closest relative. "Brother, I won't leave. With you here, with the people I care about, this is my home."

The Crown Prince smiled, gently wiping the corner of his eye: "Good, having a home is good."

They chatted for a long time, from poetry and literature to various aspects of the world, from the snow scenery at the foot of Kunlun Mountain to the water towns of Jiangnan. Zhu Changlan talked about interesting things in the Spirit Valley, about the life-saving grace of the White-robed Taoist, about the kind-hearted people he met while wandering the human world; the Crown Prince talked about interesting things in the court, about hunting with the Emperor when he was a child, about his expectations for the future.

The candle gradually burned out, and the sky outside began to turn pale. Zhu Changlan yawned, his eyes filled with exhaustion.

"Go back and sleep." The Crown Prince said with a smile: "You've been up all night; you must be tired."

Zhu Changlan nodded, getting up: "Brother, you should rest early too. Don't overwork yourself."

"I will." 
The Crown Prince nodded, watching him walk out of the side hall, until his figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, then turned back to the desk. He picked up the memorial on the desk, his gaze becoming firm again.

For the sake of his Ninth Brother, for the sake of the Great Ming, he must clear all obstacles and guard this hard-won peace.

## Part Two: Hidden Currents—Counterattack of Remaining Forces

When Zhu Changlan returned to Tranquility Peace Palace, it was already dawn. Little Salary had already prepared washing supplies and breakfast, and upon seeing him return, immediately greeted him: "Your Highness, you're back. You stayed up all night; hurry and wash up, eat something, then sleep well."

Zhu Changlan nodded, washed up, and sat at the table to eat breakfast. The breakfast was his favorite crab roe dumplings and almond cheese, but he had little appetite, his mind always thinking about the Crown Prince's worries. He knew the Crown Prince's concerns were not unfounded—the remaining forces of Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince, along with the threat of the Black Bone Sect, were like swords hanging overhead, could fall at any moment.

After breakfast, Zhu Changlan lay on the couch but couldn't fall asleep. He circulated his demon power, sensing the aura in the palace. Sure enough, he detected several unusual auras with faint black energy, lurking around the Eastern Palace and Tranquility Peace Palace—they were remaining demon creatures of the Black Bone Sect and Concubine Zheng's remaining followers.

"It seems they won't give up easily." 
Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold. He got up, walked to the window, looking at the osmanthus tree in the courtyard, thinking about countermeasures. Although Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince had been imprisoned, their followers were still active, and the Black Bone Sect was secretly dormant. Completely eliminating these threats would not be easy.

As he was thinking, Taoist Xuan Chen, a disciple of Qingyun Temple, entered, bowing: "Greetings to Ninth Prince."

"Taoist Xuan Chen, no need for formalities." Zhu Changlan said: "You came to see me, is there something important?"

"Returning to Your Highness," 
Taoist Xuan Chen said: "We've detected remaining demon creatures of the Black Bone Sect and Concubine Zheng's followers lurking in the palace,seemingly plotting something. The Abbot asked us to remind Your Highness to be careful."

"I've already detected them." 
Zhu Changlan nodded: "These people must be trying to rescue Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince, or target me and the Crown Prince."

"Exactly what Your Highness said." 
Taoist Xuan Chen said: "We've already reinforced the defenses of the Eastern Palace and Tranquility Peace Palace. If they make any moves, we will immediately take action."

"Good." 
Zhu Changlan nodded: "Thank you for your hard work. Also, please inform Abbot Xuan Qing to pay more attention to the movements of the Black Bone Sect leader. According to the Crown Prince, the Black Bone Sect leader's target is the Spirit Vein Source at the foot of Kunlun Mountain. We can't be careless."

"Your Highness can rest assured. The Abbot has already sent people to Kunlun Mountain to reinforce the barrier and monitor the movements of the Black Bone Sect."
Taoist Xuan Chen said.

Zhu Changlan breathed a sigh of relief: "Thank you, Abbot and Taoist."

Taoist Xuan Chen bowed and turned to leave. Zhu Changlan watched his back, feeling more at ease. With the help of Qingyun Temple and the protection of the Crown Prince, he believed that no matter what difficulties they faced, they could handle them together.

But he never expected danger to come so quickly.

At noon that day, the Crown Prince was discussing state affairs with the Emperor in the Imperial Study when several black-clad men broke in, wielding sharp blades, charging straight at the Emperor and the Crown Prince. These black-clad men were followers of Concubine Zheng, with high martial arts skills and ruthless attacks.

"Protect the Emperor!" The Crown Prince shouted, standing in front of the Emperor and engaging in combat with the black-clad men.

The guards from the Imperial Study immediately rushed in, fighting with the black-clad men. But these black-clad men were extremely powerful, and the guards gradually fell behind. Although the Crown Prince had practiced martial arts, he gradually became exhausted, with a deep cut on his arm.

"Brother!"
Zhu Changlan's voice came. He had detected the disturbance in the Imperial Study and immediately rushed over with Qingyun Temple disciples.

Zhu Changlan burst into the Imperial Study, seeing the Crown Prince injured, his eyes instantly turned cold. He gripped the dagger at his waist, the cat's eye gem glowing blue, golden demon power surging as he charged at one of the black-clad men.

"Puchi"—the dagger pierced the black-clad man's chest. The man screamed and fell to the ground.

The other black-clad men roared, simultaneously charging at Zhu Changlan. Qingyun Temple disciples immediately cast spells, golden talismans flying through the air, attacking the black-clad men.

Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, like a cat darting between the black-clad men, his dagger swirling in an impenetrable defense, each swing taking a black-clad man's life. The Crown Prince also seized the opportunity to counterattack, joining forces with the guards to quickly eliminate the remaining black-clad men.

The Imperial Study was in chaos, with black-clad men's bodies lying on the ground, blood staining the floor. The Emperor's face was pale, clearly frightened. The Crown Prince's arm was still bleeding, his face also pale.

"Brother, how are you?" Zhu Changlan hurriedly walked to the Crown Prince, his voice filled with anxiety.

"I'm fine." The Crown Prince shook his head, looking at the Emperor: "Father, are you okay?"

The Emperor regained his composure, waving his hand: "I'm fine. Thanks to you two brothers, otherwise, I wouldn't have escaped today."
He looked at the bodies on the ground, his eyes filled with rage: "These rebels dare to break into the Imperial Study and assassinate me and the Crown Prince—they're audacious!"

"Father, these people are followers of Concubine Zheng." 
The Crown Prince said: "They're not reconciled that Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince were imprisoned, so they wanted to assassinate you and me to cause chaos."

The Emperor was furious: "Good! Good! What a Duke of Zhenguo! What a Concubine Zheng! I won't spare them!"
He shouted outside: "Come, pass on my decree—execute the entire Duke of Zhenguo family, and give Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince death by poison in the prison!"

"Observe the decree!" The guards took the order and turned to leave.

Zhu Changlan looked at the Emperor's furious expression, feeling relieved. The remaining forces of Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince would finally be completely eliminated.

## Part Three: Worry—The Crisis of the Spirit Vein, Uncertain Future

After dealing with Concubine Zheng's followers, the palace temporarily regained peace. The Crown Prince's wound gradually healed under the imperial physician's treatment. But Zhu Changlan and the Crown Prince both knew this was only temporary peace—the threat of the Black Bone Sect still existed.

One day, while Zhu Changlan was meditating in the courtyard of Tranquility Peace Palace, Taoist Xuan Qing suddenly visited. In the courtyard of Tranquility Peace Palace, a breeze blew, the branches and leaves of the osmanthus tree rustling, bringing a faint fragrance. Zhu Changlan sat at the stone table, a pot of freshly brewed tea in front of him, steam curling up and interweaving with his surrounding spiritual energy, forming a faint light screen. Beside the ancient well in the east of the courtyard, Little Salary was washing tea sets, and upon seeing Taoist Xuan Qing arrive, immediately stood up to bow.

"Daoist, why have you come?" Zhu Changlan quickly got up, bowing.

"Xuan Yu, something has happened." 
Taoist Xuan Qing's expression was grave: "The barrier on Kunlun Mountain has been broken by the Black Bone Sect leader."

Zhu Changlan's face instantly turned pale: "What? How could the barrier be broken?"

"The Black Bone Sect leader has cultivated an extremely evil technique, greatly enhancing his strength." 
Taoist Xuan Qing said: "He led a large number of demon creatures to attack the barrier, and our disciples fought to the death but still couldn't hold it. Now, Black Bone Sect demon creatures have broken into the Spirit Vein Source, greedily absorbing the spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein."

Zhu Changlan's body trembled slightly. The Spirit Vein Source was the place his clan had guarded for generations, his root. Now that it was violated by the Black Bone Sect, how could he not be anxious? "The Spirit Vein Source is protected by my clan's barrier. How could Black Bone Sect demon creatures approach it easily?"

"The barrier is strong, but it can't withstand years of consumption." 
Taoist Xuan Qing said: "The Black Bone Sect has been secretly eroding the barrier all these years, and now it has developed cracks. Moreover, the Black Bone Sect leader has cultivated an evil technique that requires absorbing the spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein Source to break through his realm. He will do whatever it takes to destroy the barrier and seize the Spirit Vein Source."

"I must go." Zhu Changlan said firmly, "I am a Snow Spirit Cat, the guardian of the Spirit Vein Source. This is my responsibility."

"But......" The Crown Prince wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Zhu Changlan.

"Brother, I've made up my mind." 
Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince with firm eyes: "I am a Snow Spirit Cat, the guardian of the Spirit Vein Source. This is my duty. Rest assured, I will protect myself and return safely."

The Crown Prince looked at his firm gaze, knowing he couldn't stop him. He sighed, his eyes full of worry: "Alright, I agree. But you must promise me to protect yourself. No matter what danger you encounter, you must come back alive."

"I will." Zhu Changlan nodded.

The Crown Prince took out a brocade box from his sleeve, handing it to Zhu Changlan: "This is a protective jade pendant given to me by Father, which can block three fatal attacks. Take it with you; it might be useful in danger."
He paused, then handed him a small porcelain bottle: "This is a special healing medicine made by Imperial Physician Li, with excellent efficacy. Take it with you."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade box and porcelain bottle, carefully putting them away: "Thank you, Brother."

"I've already prepared carriages and travel expenses, and arranged for Qingyun Temple disciples to accompany you." 
The Crown Prince said: "I will stay in the capital to handle court affairs and provide support for you. If you encounter danger, immediately send someone back with a message, and I will send troops to support you."

"Alright." Zhu Changlan nodded, filled with gratitude.

Taoist Xuan Qing said: "Your Highness, rest assured. We will protect His Highness Ninth Prince's safety. Moreover, righteous cultivators from various places have already rushed here upon hearing the news, and we will join forces to deal with the Black Bone Sect leader."

The Crown Prince nodded, looking at Zhu Changlan with reluctance: "Ninth Brother, be careful on your journey. Return soon. I'll wait for you in the capital."

"Brother, take care." Zhu Changlan bowed, then turned and followed Taoist Xuan Qing out of the palace.

The carriage slowly left the capital. Zhu Changlan sat in the carriage, lifting the curtain to watch the capital's silhouette gradually fade away, feeling full of reluctance. He knew this journey would be full of danger. But he had no fear—for the sake of guarding the Spirit Vein Source, for the sake of guarding the Great Ming, for the sake of guarding the Crown Prince, he must move forward bravely.

## Part Four: Kunlun Battlefield—Black Wind Blows Snow, Demon Flames Rage

### 1. Arrival: Spirit Vein Weeps Blood, Barrier Collapses

Seven days later, Zhu Changlan and his group arrived at the foot of Kunlun Mountain.

The scenery outside the window was no longer as beautiful as he remembered—
The Kunlun main peak, which was covered in snow all year round, was now shrouded in a thick layer of black energy, like a huge piece of jade pressing against the sky. The Spirit Valley at the foot of the mountain was no longer lush with plants; the stream had frozen into ice, and the bodies of fish and shrimp could be faintly seen beneath the ice, exuding a faint black aura. The air was filled with a strong smell of blood and evil energy, choking one's throat.

"The barrier collapsed on the west side of the main peak." Taoist Xuan Qing pointed to the distant mountains, his voice grave.

Zhu Changlan followed his finger, seeing that in the sky on the west side of the main peak, the barrier that should have glowed with pale golden spiritual energy was now like broken glass, covered with spiderweb-like cracks, black energy surging out from the cracks, dyeing half the sky black. From the direction of the Spirit Vein Source, there came faint rumbles, like the earth crying.

"Let's hurry." 
Zhu Changlan gripped the dagger at his waist, the cat's eye gem glowing faintly blue in the black energy: "The spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein is rapidly dissipating."

The group changed to horses, galloping up the frozen mountain path. The closer they got to the main peak, the thicker the black energy became, and from time to time they could see the bodies of Qingyun Temple disciples and Black Bone Sect demon creatures along the road. Some disciples were charred black, obviously burned to death by evil fire; others were eroded by black energy, their bodies twisted and deformed, dying in tragic ways.

Zhu Changlan's heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand. These disciples had died to protect the Spirit Vein Source, and their sacrifice only strengthened his determination to eliminate the Black Bone Sect leader.

When they arrived at the Spirit Vein Source, the scene before them shocked everyone.

The Spirit Vein Source was a huge valley, with golden spiritual springs flowing at the bottom. The spring eyes, which should have been surrounded by strong spiritual energy, were now wrapped in black energy. Hundreds of Black Bone Sect demon creatures surrounded the spring eyes, sitting cross-legged, greedily absorbing the spiritual energy of the spiritual springs, their bodies expanding continuously, their auras growing stronger.

In the center of the valley, a man in a black robe stood with his back to them, floating above the spiritual spring. He was tall, with eerie black patterns embroidered on his robe, and black energy swirling around him, almost solidifying. The golden spiritual energy of the spring was continuously drawn into his body, his aura becoming increasingly terrifying, and even the surrounding space was slightly distorted.

"Black Bone Sect leader!" Taoist Xuan Qing growled, gripping his fly whisk tightly.

The man in black robe slowly turned around, revealing a pale face. His eyes were pure black without whites, exuding a cold, evil light. A cruel smile curved on his lips: "Xuan Qing, you came just in time. After I absorb the spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein Source and break through my realm, you'll be the first to die."

His gaze swept over Zhu Changlan, his pupils shrinking slightly: "Snow Spirit Cat? I never expected the guardian of the Spirit Vein Source to still be alive."

Zhu Changlan's eyes were cold, golden demon power surging around him: "Black Bone Sect leader, you slaughtered living beings, destroyed the Spirit Vein. Today, I will act on behalf of heaven and eliminate you!"

"Act on behalf of heaven?" 
The leader sneered, black energy erupting: "In this world, the strong prey on the weak. The spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein Source should belong to the strong. How dare you, a mere cat demon, be so arrogant in front of me?"

Before he finished speaking, the leader raised his hand, and several black demon whips emerged from the black energy,with a piercing whistling sound, charging straight at Zhu Changlan. The demon whips were covered with barbs, glowing with a green poisonous light, clearly coated with poison.

"Watch out!" Taoist Xuan Qing quickly swung his fly whisk, golden spiritual energy forming a barrier to block the demon whips.

"Bang"—with a loud noise, the golden barrier was shattered by the demon whips, and Taoist Xuan Qing staggered back several steps, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.

"Abbot!" The Qingyun Temple disciples exclaimed, taking out talismans and forming a formation.

"Useless." 
The leader sneered, waving his black robe, and more demon whips emerged, like a black net, covering everyone. At the same time, the Black Bone Sect demon creatures absorbing spiritual energy also stood up, roaring and charging forward.

"Xuan Chen, take the disciples to deal with the demon creatures!" Taoist Xuan Qing shouted, "Xuan Yu, let's join forces to deal with the leader!"

"Alright!" 
Zhu Changlan responded, his figure flashing like a golden afterimage, charging at the leader. The cat's eye gem on his dagger erupted with bright blue light, golden demon power intertwining with blue light, forming a sharp sword qi.

The leader sidestepped the sword qi, waving his black robe, and a black demon fire shot at Zhu Changlan. When the demon fire landed, it burst into raging black flames, burning the ground with a hissing sound, melting even the stones.

Zhu Changlan moved flexibly, darting through the black flames, his dagger swirling in an impenetrable defense, continuously attacking the leader. Taoist Xuan Qing also made his move, his fly whisk swept, golden talismans like rain, attacking the leader's vital points.

The leader's strength far exceeded their imagination. He blocked their joint attack with just one person, black energy continuously surging, his moves ruthless and deadly.

"Puchi"—Zhu Changlan's shoulder was swept by a demon whip, his brocade robe instantly torn, blood gushing out. Black energy invaded his body through the wound, like countless ice needles, stabbing his meridians with pain.

"Your Highness Ninth Prince!" 
Taoist Xuan Chen exclaimed, wanting to come to his aid but was entangled by several powerful demon creatures, unable to break free.

Zhu Changlan grunted, circulating his demon power to forcefully suppress the black energy in his body, his dagger once again stabbing at the leader's forehead.

The leader sneered, raising his hand to grab the dagger, black energy spreading along the dagger, trying to erode Zhu Changlan's arm. "A mere cat demon, dare to hurt me?"

Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, his demon power surging as golden demon power flowed into the leader's palm through the dagger. The leader's expression changed—he never expected Zhu Changlan's demon power to be so pure, quickly releasing his hand and retreating several steps.

"Your demon power is stronger than I thought." 
The leader's eyes turned colder: "But that's as far as you go!"

He formed seals with his hands, the black patterns on his robe glowing, thick black energy gushing from his body, condensing into a huge black demon claw, slapping at Zhu Changlan. The demon claw blocked out the sky,with destructive momentum, even the surrounding spiritual energy was sucked into chaos.

"Xuan Yu, dodge!"
Taoist Xuan Qing exclaimed, trying to rush over to block but was repelled by the leader's black energy.

Zhu Changlan knew he couldn't dodge. He gripped his dagger, pouring all his demon power into it. The blue light of the cat's eye gem merged with the golden demon power, forming a huge golden shield.

"Bang ------"

The demon claw slammed into the shield with a deafening crash. The golden shield trembled violently, appearing countless cracks. Zhu Changlan's mouth overflowed with blood, his body thrown backward by the immense impact, landing heavily on the ground, his chest heaving, qi and blood churning.

The shield shattered, and the black demon claw, with remaining momentum, slapped at Zhu Changlan again.

At this critical moment, the protective jade pendant at Zhu Changlan's waist suddenly glowed, a golden light enveloping him. The demon claw slapped on the light and was forcibly blocked back.

"Father's protective jade pendant!" Zhu Changlan rejoiced, quickly taking the opportunity to get up and circulate his demon power to heal his wounds.

The leader looked at the golden light with a colder gaze: "A royal protective jade pendant? It has some tricks. But it can only protect you once!"

He raised his hand again, black energy condensing into several black spears, shooting at Zhu Changlan. The spearswith a piercing whistling sound, flying with astonishing speed.

The phantom of Zhu Changlan's tail materialized behind him, the fluffy white tail wreathed in golden demon power, like a fan, sweeping away most of the spears. But one spear still broke through the defense, stabbing his abdomen.

"Puchi"—the spear pierced his abdomen, blood instantly staining his robe. Zhu Changlan grunted, his face as white as paper, his demon power instantly disrupted.

"Your Highness Ninth Prince!"
Taoist Xuan Qing's eyes were splitting, charging at the leader recklessly, the golden spiritual energy on his fly whisk surging: "I'll fight you to the death!"

The leader sneered, waving his hand, a black energy blast sent Taoist Xuan Qing flying. Taoist Xuan Qing landed heavily, spitting out a large mouthful of blood, struggling to get up but found his meridians sealed by black energy, unable to move.

"Abbot!" The Qingyun Temple disciples were anxious but were tightly entangled by demon creatures, powerless.

The leader walked slowly toward Zhu Changlan, his eyes cold: "Snow Spirit Cat, your nine lives will end here today. Hand over your spiritual source, and I'll give you a quick death."

Zhu Changlan struggled to stand, blood at the corner of his mouth, but his gaze remained firm: "Dream on!"

He suddenly circulated the remaining demon power in his body, exerting the cat's eye gem to its limit. The blue light on the dagger became increasingly intense, even overshadowing the black energy. He thought of the Crown Prince's advice, the clan of the Spirit Valley, the sacrifice of Qingyun Temple disciples, and a powerful force surged from the bottom of his heart.

"With my thousand-year demon power, I offer my Snow Spirit Cat soul ------"
Zhu Changlan's voice was hoarse but firm, golden demon power surging around him, forming a huge cat-shaped phantom: "Spirit Vein Guardian, All Demons Retreat!"

The cat-shaped phantom let out a deafening roar, charging at the leader.
Wherever the phantom passed, black energy dissipated, demon creatures screamed, their bodies torn apart by the phantom's power.

The leader's face changed drastically, never expecting Zhu Changlan to erupt with such powerful energy. He quickly circulated black energy, forming a black barrier.

"Bang ------"

The cat-shaped phantom slammed into the barrier, and the black barrier instantly covered with cracks. The leader spat out a large mouthful of black blood, his body retreating several steps, his face becoming even paler.

Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, his figure flashing to the leader's front, his dagger wreathed in golden demon power and blue light, stabbing fiercely at the leader's heart.

The leader tried to dodge but was entangled by the cat-shaped phantom, unable to move. "Puchi"—the dagger accurately pierced his heart.

Golden demon power flowed into the leader's body through the dagger, destroying his meridians and spiritual consciousness. The leader let out a shrill scream, his body contorting, black energy gushing from his body, gradually dissipating.

"No ------ I'm not willing!"
The leader's voice was filled with venom: "I haven't broken through my realm yet, I haven't ruled the world ------"

His body gradually turned into black energy but didn't completely dissipate. A faint black shadow flew out of the black energy, fleeing toward the outside of the valley.

"Want to run!" Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, wanting to chase but collapsed to the ground due to exhaustion of demon power.

"Your Highness Ninth Prince!" Taoist Xuan Chen broke free from the demon creatures, rushing to support him.

Zhu Changlan pointed at the black shadow: "Don't let him get away...... He's not completely dead......"

Taoist Xuan Qing struggled to get up, circulating his remaining spiritual energy, shooting a golden talisman at the black shadow. The talisman caught up to the shadow, making a loud noise, hitting the shadow and making it even weaker, but it still stubbornly fled into the depths of the Kunlun Mountains, eventually disappearing.

"We couldn't kill him completely." Taoist Xuan Qing sighed, his face full of regret.

Zhu Changlan shook his head, his breath weak: "It's okay...... He's severely injured...... He won't be able to cause trouble for a while......"

After saying this, his vision went black, and he fainted. His demon power was completely exhausted, one life already lost, his body becoming extremely weak.

### 2. Aftermath: Spirit Vein Recovers, Remnants Remain

After Zhu Changlan fainted, Taoist Xuan Qing immediately had him carried to a safe place, using Qingyun Temple's healing elixirs to treat him. At the same time, Qingyun Temple disciples and righteous cultivators from various places joined forces to clean up the remaining demon creatures in the valley.

The black energy in the Spirit Vein Source gradually dissipated, the golden spiritual spring flowed again, and spiritual energy slowly recovered. The snow on Kunlun Mountain began to melt, plants sprouted new buds, and the Spirit Valley gradually restored its former vitality.

Three days later, Zhu Changlan slowly woke up.

He lay in a temporarily built tent, his wounds already bandaged, and the black energy in his body had been cleared, but his demon power was still weak, his body light and weak.

"Your Highness Ninth Prince, you're awake!" Taoist Xuan Chen, who was guarding beside him, was overjoyed.

Zhu Changlan nodded, his voice hoarse: "How's the Spirit Vein?"

"The spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein is recovering, no major issues." 
Taoist Xuan Chen said: "The remaining demon creatures have been cleaned up, but...... the Black Bone Sect leader's residual soul escaped, which might leave future troubles."

Zhu Changlan's eyes darkened: "His residual soul...... is severely damaged...... won't be able to cause trouble...... for a short time...... But we must still be careful......"

He paused, continuing: "Please...... inform my Brother...... that the Spirit Vein Source has been protected...... I'm not in danger...... so he doesn't have to worry......"

"Alright, I'll do it right away." Taoist Xuan Chen bowed and left.

Zhu Changlan lay in the tent, looking at the canvas top, his mind filled with the Crown Prince's figure. He wondered if the Crown Prince was safe in the capital, if there were any changes in the court. What he wanted most now was to quickly recover his demon power, return to the capital, and be by the Crown Prince's side.

Taoist Xuan Qing entered, holding a bowl of healing medicine: "Xuan Yu, drink some medicine. This is made with Spirit Vein spring water and thousand-year spiritual herbs, which can help you recover your demon power."

Zhu Changlan took the medicine bowl and drank it all. The medicine was bitter but full of strong spiritual energy, sliding down his throat and nourishing his damaged meridians.

"Thank you, Taoist." Zhu Changlan said.

"No need for thanks." 
Taoist Xuan Qing said: "You sacrificed a life and exhausted your thousand-year demon power to guard the Spirit Vein Source. This kindness, Qingyun Temple will never forget."

Zhu Changlan shook his head: "Guarding the Spirit Vein Source...... is my responsibility......"

They chatted for a while, then Taoist Xuan Qing taught him some methods to recover demon power and left, letting him rest well.

Zhu Changlan closed his eyes, circulating the method taught by Taoist Xuan Qing, absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy. The spiritual energy of the Spirit Vein Source was rich and pure, nourishing his body and demon power. He could feel his demon power slowly recovering, but it would take time to return to its peak state.

## Part Five: Capital Worry—The Crown Prince's Sleepless Night

At the same time, in the Eastern Palace of the capital.

When the Crown Prince received the message from Taoist Xuan Chen, learning that the Spirit Vein Source had been protected and Zhu Changlan was not in danger, he felt slightly relieved. But when he learned that Zhu Changlan had lost a life and exhausted his thousand-year demon power, he was filled with worry and heartache.

"Ninth Brother, why are you so stupid." 
The Crown Prince sat in the side hall, looking at the osmanthus wine Zhu Changlan had given him, his eyes turning red: "You could have not been so desperate."

He picked up the osmanthus wine, opened the lid, the rich osmanthus fragrance filling the air but no longer sweet. He remembered the scene of them chatting in the Eastern Palace at night, the proud smile on Zhu Changlan's face when he brewed osmanthus wine, and his firm gaze before departure, his heart full of worry.

That night, the Crown Prince stayed awake all night. He sat in the side hall, watching the candlelight, silently praying for Zhu Changlan, hoping he would recover soon and return safely.

The next morning, after handling court affairs, the Crown Prince immediately had carriages prepared, wanting to go to Kunlun Mountain to visit Zhu Changlan. But as soon as he reached the palace gate, he was stopped by ministers.

"Your Highness, you cannot leave the capital." 
The Prime Minister bowed: "Now the court has just stabilized, and the Black Bone Sect's remnants are not yet eliminated. If you leave, the capital might face changes."

"Yes, Your Highness." 
Other ministers also echoed: "His Highness Ninth Prince is blessed, and will definitely return safely. As the Crown Prince, you should prioritize the overall situation."

Looking at the ministers' sincere eyes, the Crown Prince felt helpless. He knew they were right—he couldn't leave the capital. But he was truly worried about Zhu Changlan, wanting to fly to his side immediately, to take care of him and stay with him.

"I understand." The Crown Prince sighed, turning back to the Eastern Palace: "You may leave."

Returning to the Eastern Palace, the Crown Prince had a large number of healing elixirs and tonics prepared, letting Taoist Xuan Chen's disciples send them to Kunlun Mountain, ensuring Zhu Changlan received the best treatment. He also personally wrote a letter, instructing Zhu Changlan to rest well, not rush to recover his demon power, and return to the capital slowly when he felt better, assuring him he would wait for him in the capital.

## Part Six: Return—Warmth Endures, Years Peaceful

A month later, Zhu Changlan finally returned to the capital.

The Crown Prince personally went to the palace gate to greet him. Seeing Zhu Changlan step down from the carriage, his face pale but still spirited, the Crown Prince was filled with excitement.

"Ninth Brother!" The Crown Prince quickly stepped forward, hugging him tightly.

"Brother." Zhu Changlan also hugged the Crown Prince tightly, his voice full of longing.

"You're back, you're back." 
The Crown Prince released him, looking him over carefully: "How's your body? How's your demon power recovering?"

"Much better." 
Zhu Changlan smiled: "Taoist Xuan Qing gave me many healing elixirs, and my demon power has recovered most of it."

The Crown Prince nodded, pulling him toward the Eastern Palace: "Quick, come with me. I asked the kitchen to prepare your favorite crab roe dumplings and almond cheese."

Zhu Changlan smiled and nodded, following the Crown Prince into the Eastern Palace. In the courtyard of the Eastern Palace, osmanthus flowers were already blooming, their fragrance filling the air. On the table were his favorite dishes, along with a pot of warm osmanthus wine.

They sat down, and the Crown Prince poured him a cup of osmanthus wine: "Cheers, to your safe return."

Zhu Changlan raised his cup, clinking it with the Crown Prince's: "Cheers."

The sweet fragrance of osmanthus wine spread in his mouth, like a warm current, warming his heart. Looking at the Crown Prince's gentle smile, listening to the chirping of insects in the courtyard, feeling the warmth around him, he felt unprecedentedly at peace.

"Brother, although the Black Bone Sect leader wasn't completely killed, he's severely injured and won't be able to cause trouble for a while. The Spirit Vein Source has recovered, and the Great Ming is finally at peace." 
Zhu Changlan said.

"Yes, peace at last." 
The Crown Prince smiled: "All of this is thanks to you. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to defeat the Black Bone Sect leader."

"This is what I should do." 
Zhu Changlan said: "Guarding the Spirit Vein Source, guarding the Great Ming, guarding you—all are my responsibilities."

The Crown Prince looked at him with gentle eyes: "Ninth Brother, from now on, there will be no more wars, no more dangers. We can read, admire flowers, and drink osmanthus wine together in the Eastern Palace, living the life we want."

Zhu Changlan nodded, a happy smile on his face. He knew that the most precious things in this world were not immortality cultivation or supreme power, but family, sincere friendship, and this warmth guarded through storms.

As the sun set, its golden light cast upon the courtyard of the Eastern Palace, stretching their shadows long. The fragrance of osmanthus flowers filled the air, interweaving with the sweetness of osmanthus wine, composing the gentlest melody.

Zhu Changlan knew that the days ahead would be full of sunshine and warmth. He would stay with the Crown Prince, guarding this Great Ming, guarding this hard-won peace, guarding this deep brotherly love forever. And the escaped residual soul of the Black Bone Sect leader, like a tiny thorn, lurked in the shadows, planting a hint of suspense for the future—would he make a comeback? When would the next crisis arrive?
