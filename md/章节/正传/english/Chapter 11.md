**Chapter 11: The Life Soul Pearl, A Gentle Light Protecting Its Master**

The 25th year of Wanli's reign, late autumn.

Zhu Changlan had been away from the capital for over half a month.

Qingyun Temple stood atop Qixia Mountain in the western suburbs of the capital, built into the mountainside with gray bricks and dark tiles hidden among lush pine and cypress trees. Year-round mist and clouds surrounded it, like a fairyland on earth. Far from the capital's hustle and bustle, free from the royal court's intrigues and deceptions, only the morning bells and evening drums, the rustle of pine waves, and the songs of birds filled the air—an ideal place for quiet recuperation.

Zhu Changlan resided in Jingyun Pavilion, located to the west behind the temple. The courtyard was small but elegant and serene. Several osmanthus trees grew within, now in full bloom with tiny golden flowers covering the branches. A gentle breeze carried the petals, filling the air with a rich, sweet fragrance. Every day at dawn, he would rise and practice a basic demon technique of the Snow Spirit Cat clan in the courtyard, then sit quietly by the window, either reading Taoist scriptures sent by Taoist Priest Xuan Chen or closing his eyes to regulate his breathing, healing the old wounds from the Southern Border War and his imprisonment in the Heavenly Prison.

During these days, Zhu Changlan clearly felt changes within his body. Since leaving the capital, a faint yet warm current had often stirred deep within his dantian. At first, he thought it was just the lingering effect of healing pills and didn't pay much attention. But as he rested in Qingyun Temple longer, this warm current became clearer and gradually began to flow on its own, slowly traversing his meridians. Wherever it passed, his damaged meridians repaired at a visible rate, and the lingering pain from demonic qi corrosion dissipated significantly.

One afternoon, Zhu Changlan sat in meditation as usual. Following the breathing method taught by Taoist Priest Xuan Chen, he focused his mind and guided the demonic energy around his body to circulate through his meridians. When the demonic energy reached his dantian, the gentle warm current suddenly became active, intertwining with his demonic energy and flowing together through his meridians. Zhu Changlan was startled, quickly focusing his mind to carefully sense the source of this warm current.

He could clearly detect that this warm current originated from an intangible object deep within his dantian, something that seemed closely connected to his soul. It rose and fell with his breath, emitting a faint golden light. He attempted to use his demonic energy to touch this object—at the first contact, he felt a soft yet resilient force pushing back, followed by a faint golden light spilling from his dantian, spreading through his meridians to every part of his body, instantly dispelling the last trace of evil qi remaining within him.

"What is this..." Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, a hint of confusion in them. He had never known such a strange object existed within him. This power was pure and gentle, completely different from his Snow Spirit Cat demonic energy, yet it could perfectly blend with and complement his demonic energy.

At that moment, a soft knock sounded at the courtyard gate, followed by Taoist Priest Xuan Chen's voice: "Your Highness, I've come to visit."

Zhu Changlan rose to open the door, greeting him with a bow: "Please come in, Taoist Priest."

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen entered the courtyard, his gaze sweeping over Zhu Changlan's face with a hint of surprise: "Your Highness looks exceptionally well today. It seems your old wounds have healed completely." Having cultivated for many years, his eyesight was extraordinary—he immediately noticed that Zhu Changlan's demonic energy had become much more refined, with a faint golden light surrounding him, and his aura was much more stable than before.

Hearing this, Zhu Changlan took the opportunity to ask: "Taoist Priest, while meditating today, I detected a strange warm current deep within my dantian, originating from an intangible object. Could you please explain this to me?" He told Xuan Chen in detail what he had experienced during meditation, his tone filled with confusion.

Upon hearing this, Xuan Chen's expression grew serious. After a moment of thought, he said: "Your Highness, could you activate your demonic energy so I can see?"

Zhu Changlan nodded, activating his demonic energy as instructed. In an instant, the golden light from deep within his dantian spilled out again, surrounding him with a faint golden glow. Though not blinding, it emanated a pure and sacred aura.

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen stared at the golden light, a flash of shock in his eyes followed by understanding. Stroking his beard, he slowly said: "So that's it. What resides within Your Highness is a Life Soul Pearl."

"A Life Soul Pearl?" Zhu Changlan asked in confusion. "What is a Life Soul Pearl?" He had known since childhood that he possessed Snow Spirit Cat demonic energy, but had never heard of a Life Soul Pearl. No relevant records existed in the palace classics or the clan's inherited memories.

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen explained slowly: "A Life Soul Pearl is born from the fusion of a heaven and earth spiritual object with a demon soul. It is not something ordinary demons can possess—only descendants of demon clans with extremely pure bloodlines and special missions may develop a Life Soul Pearl at birth. This pearl is closely connected to its host's soul; it exists as long as the host lives, and dissipates when the host dies. It can automatically absorb heaven and earth spiritual energy to nourish the host's meridians and demonic energy, and when the host is in danger, it automatically activates a defense to protect its master."

Pausing for a moment, Xuan Chen continued: "Your Highness is a pure-blooded descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, which is an ancient spiritual demon. Your bloodline contains pure heaven and earth spiritual energy. It seems this Life Soul Pearl formed when your Snow Spirit Cat bloodline fused with heaven and earth spiritual energy at birth. However, you spent many years in the palace, your mind uneasy, and repeatedly encountered danger and demonic qi侵扰, causing the pearl to remain in a dormant state. Now that you're resting peacefully in Qingyun Temple, with a calm mind and stable demonic energy, the pearl has naturally awakened."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan suddenly understood. No wonder he had recovered so quickly from his injuries, and no wonder that warm current could dispel the evil qi within him—it was all thanks to the Life Soul Pearl. But he still had one doubt: "Taoist Priest, since the Life Soul Pearl is connected to my soul, why did I never sense its presence before?"

"That's because the pearl's awakening requires a catalyst," Xuan Chen explained. "Previously, while your demonic energy was strong, it wasn't refined enough, and your mind was often disturbed by royal court conflicts and external dangers. To protect itself, the pearl remained dormant, hidden deep within your dantian. This time, you fought fiercely in the Southern Border and were imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison, your soul undergoing extreme tempering. Coupled with the peaceful environment of Qingyun Temple and the aid of the pills I gave you, all these factors combined finally triggered the pearl's awakening."

Zhu Changlan listened quietly, his heart filled with mixed emotions. He had never imagined such a precious spiritual object existed within him. This Life Soul Pearl was both his opportunity and perhaps his destiny. The inherited memories of the Snow Spirit Cat clan recorded that in ancient times, the Snow Spirit Cat clan had guarded the Source of Spiritual Veins. Could his Life Soul Pearl be related to this guardian mission?

Sensing Zhu Changlan's thoughts, Xuan Chen said: "Your Highness, the awakening of the Life Soul Pearl is no coincidence. It can not only protect you but is also inextricably linked to the Source of Spiritual Veins and the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy. Although the Black Bone Sect leader's residual soul has been eliminated, their remaining forces still exist. They have always coveted heaven and earth spiritual objects, and if they learn of the Life Soul Pearl within you, they will definitely come to抢夺 it. From now on, Your Highness will find it difficult to truly escape conflict."

Zhu Changlan's expression grew serious. He had wanted to rest in Qingyun Temple, away from the capital's conflicts and the dangers of the Black Bone Sect, but he never expected that the awakening of the Life Soul Pearl would draw him into the vortex once again. The Black Bone Sect's remaining forces hated him to the bone and coveted spiritual objects—they would never let him go.

"Thank you for your reminder, Taoist Priest. I understand," Zhu Changlan said with a bow. "I will be careful and protect the Life Soul Pearl, never allowing it to fall into the hands of the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces."

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen nodded: "It's good that Your Highness has this awareness. The Life Soul Pearl has just awakened and its power is still weak, needing to be nurtured slowly. I have a technique called 'Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Formula,' passed down from ancient times, specifically for nurturing Life Soul Pearls and enhancing their power. Your Highness can practice according to this technique. When the pearl's power matures, it can not only protect you completely but also help you break through your demonic energy realm and unleash the true strength of the Snow Spirit Cat clan."

With that, Xuan Chen took out a yellowed ancient book from his bosom and handed it to Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan accepted the ancient book, filled with gratitude: "Thank you for your generous gift, Taoist Priest. I will practice diligently."

Xuan Chen instructed him on a few matters regarding cultivation, then got up to leave. The awakening of the Life Soul Pearl was both an opportunity and a crisis for Zhu Changlan—he would have to walk the road ahead by himself.

After Xuan Chen left, Zhu Changlan returned to his room and opened the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Formula" to study carefully. The text was ancient and difficult to understand, but fortunately, Zhu Changlan had studied extensively since childhood and had the inherited memories of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, so he could gradually comprehend it. The formula recorded that nurturing a Life Soul Pearl required using one's own demonic energy as a guide to absorb heaven and earth spiritual energy and inject it into the pearl. Only through day after day, year after year of practice could the pearl's power gradually grow. And as the pearl's power increased, the host's demonic energy and soul would also be nourished, growing together.

From that day on, Zhu Changlan practiced according to the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Formula" every day. He rose before dawn and went to the viewing platform at the top of Qixia Mountain, the best place in Qingyun Temple to absorb heaven and earth spiritual energy. Sitting cross-legged, he focused his mind, following the formula's instructions to guide the heaven and earth spiritual energy and his own demonic energy, slowly injecting them into the Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian.

At first, the pearl absorbed spiritual energy very slowly. Most of the injected spiritual energy dissipated in his meridians, with only a small fraction truly absorbed by the pearl. But Zhu Changlan was not discouraged; he persisted in his practice day after day. He knew that nurturing the pearl was not something that could be accomplished overnight—it required enough patience and perseverance.

As days passed, Zhu Changlan's practice gradually showed results. The pearl's absorption of spiritual energy became faster and faster, and the golden light deep within his dantian grew more intense. Whenever he practiced the technique, a faint golden light would surround him, intertwining with his golden demonic energy to form a strange light screen. He could clearly feel his demonic energy becoming more refined, his soul more stable. The old wounds from previous battles had completely healed, and his demonic energy realm even showed signs of breaking through.

Meanwhile, news came from the capital. Zhu Changluo sent a letter informing Zhu Changlan that Zheng Guifei and Xiao Ze's remaining followers had been completely eliminated, the Minister of Rites and other officials involved in framing him had been investigated, and the court situation was gradually stabilizing. Zhu Changluo also instructed him to rest peacefully in Qingyun Temple and not return to the capital easily—he would inform Zhu Changlan immediately of any developments in the capital.

Reading the letter, Zhu Changlan felt a warm current in his heart. In this cold royal family, only Zhu Changluo had always stood by him and treated him sincerely. He picked up his brush to reply, telling Zhu Changluo that everything was well in Qingyun Temple and not hiding the awakening of the Life Soul Pearl, but instructing him not to make it public to avoid unnecessary trouble.

Upon receiving the reply, Zhu Changluo was both shocked and delighted. He never expected Zhu Changlan to have such a chance with the Life Soul Pearl, but at the same time, he became even more worried about his safety. The Black Bone Sect's remaining forces were still causing trouble, and if they learned of the Life Soul Pearl within Zhu Changlan, they would stop at nothing to抢夺 it. He immediately ordered more Eastern Palace elites to be secretly dispatched to lurk around Qixia Mountain, secretly protecting Zhu Changlan's safety.

Zhu Changlan was unaware of Zhu Changluo's secret arrangements. Besides nurturing the Life Soul Pearl, he also wandered around Qingyun Temple every day, chatting with the Taoist priests and learning about Qixia Mountain's customs and Qingyun Temple's history. He gradually fell in love with the tranquility and harmony here, and even had a thought: if he could stay here forever, away from conflicts, how wonderful that would be.

But he also knew this was just a奢望. As long as the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces existed, he could never truly be at peace. Moreover, as a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, he bore the mission of guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins. The awakening of the Life Soul Pearl had already tightly bound him to this mission—he was destined to not be able to escape.

One day, after finishing his practice, Zhu Changlan went down the mountain alone to the village at the foot to purchase some daily necessities. The village at the foot of Qixia Mountain was called Qixia Village, where most villagers made a living by farming and collecting herbs, with simple and honest folk customs. Every time Zhu Changlan went down the mountain, he would chat with the villagers and buy some fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Although the villagers didn't know his identity, they liked this gentle and polite young man very much.

But today, as soon as Zhu Changlan entered Qixia Village, he sensed something was wrong. The usually lively village was异常 quiet, with no one on the streets and not even the sound of chickens or dogs. The air was filled with a faint smell of blood and evil qi.

Zhu Changlan's heart tightened. He immediately concealed his aura, gripped the wooden sword in his hand, and cautiously walked toward the village's depths. Following the street, he saw that every household's door was wide open, and the rooms inside were in chaos—tables and chairs overturned, with clothes and debris scattered on the ground, clearly indicating they had been through a disaster.

"Is anyone there?" Zhu Changlan called softly, but no one responded.

When he reached the village's central threshing ground, Zhu Changlan finally saw the villagers. Dozens of villagers were tied to stone pillars in the threshing ground, all with frightened expressions and trembling bodies. In front of them stood more than a dozen people in black clothes wearing masks, their bodies surrounded by a thick black qi—clearly the remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect.

"Speak! Is the Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan from Qingyun Temple often coming here?" A leader in black held a sharp blade to an old man's neck, demanding harshly. The old man was the village chief of Qixia Village. His face was pale, but he clenched his teeth and refused to speak.

"Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit!" The leader in black's eyes flashed with cruelty, and he pressed the blade slightly harder—the old man's neck immediately oozed blood.

"Stop!" Zhu Changlan shouted angrily, stepping out from the shadows. He never expected that the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces would find this place and use the villagers' lives to threaten him.

When the leader in black saw Zhu Changlan, his eyes lit up with delight: "Zhu Changlan! So it's you! We've been looking for you everywhere!"

Zhu Changlan said coldly: "The Black Bone Sect leader's residual soul has been eliminated. Why haven't you remaining forces surrendered? How dare you harm the villagers here! Today I will wipe you all out!"

"Surrender?" The leader in black sneered. "Zhu Changlan, don't be arrogant! Although our leader is dead, our sect's great cause is not yet complete! Today we've come to take your life to avenge our leader!" He paused, his eyes flashing with greed. "I heard you have a Life Soul Pearl in your body. If we can seize the pearl and inject it into our sect's evil artifact, we can restart the Source of Spiritual Veins and dominate the world! Zhu Changlan, hand over the pearl obediently, and I might spare you and these villagers!"

Zhu Changlan's expression darkened. It seemed the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces had already learned about the Life Soul Pearl and had come specifically to抢夺 it. He would never let the pearl fall into these villains' hands, nor would he allow them to harm the villagers.

"Wishful thinking!" Zhu Changlan shouted angrily. His demonic energy surged, with golden demonic energy and faint golden light intertwining to form a dazzling light screen. Holding his wooden sword, he charged at the leader in black.

"Brothers, attack! Capture Zhu Changlan and seize the pearl!" The leader in black roared, commanding his subordinates to surround Zhu Changlan. These men in black were elites of the Black Bone Sect, each with agile skills and ruthless moves. Their bodies were surrounded by a thick evil qi, and their attacks carried a strong corrosive nature—if hit, one's meridians would be severed by the evil qi.

Zhu Changlan showed no fear. His wooden sword twisted into layers of sword flowers, with golden demonic energy continuously flowing from the sword. Each strike carried an unstoppable force, piercing at the men in black. His demonic energy, nourished by the Life Soul Pearl, had become much more refined, and its power was greater than before. Although there were many men in black, they couldn't get close to him for a while.

But the men in black were numerous and fearless of death. They adopted a wheel tactic, continuously attacking Zhu Changlan to consume his demonic energy. After a long battle, Zhu Changlan gradually felt his demonic energy dwindling, and his breathing became rapid.

Seeing this, the leader in black's eyes flashed with satisfaction. He knew Zhu Changlan's demonic energy was about to be exhausted—he just needed to hold on a little longer to capture him. "Zhu Changlan, you're almost done! Hand over the pearl obediently, and I can let you die quickly!" The leader in black shouted harshly.

Zhu Changlan gritted his teeth, struggling to continue fighting with the men in black. He knew he couldn't fall—once he fell, not only would the pearl be stolen, but the villagers would also be killed.

Just then, a man in black seized Zhu Changlan's opening, holding a dagger and stabbing fiercely at his back. This strike was fast and ruthless, carrying a thick evil qi—obviously intended to be fatal. Zhu Changlan was shocked, wanting to dodge, but it was too late.

At the moment the dagger was about to pierce Zhu Changlan's back, the Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian suddenly burst forth with a gentle golden light. The golden light instantly surrounded his body, forming a solid defensive barrier. "Clang!" The dagger struck the barrier, emitting a clear sound, and was instantly bounced back. The man in black was also sent flying by the barrier's erupting force, falling heavily to the ground, vomiting blood, and dying instantly.

"What kind of power is this?" The leader in black's eyes flashed with shock. He never expected Zhu Changlan's body to contain such strange power that could instantly block his subordinate's fatal strike.

Zhu Changlan was also stunned. He could clearly feel that the Life Soul Pearl was actively protecting its master—the barrier formed by the golden light not only blocked the attack but also continuously transmitted power to him, replenishing his consumed demonic energy. Overjoyed, he immediately activated the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Formula," guiding the pearl's power to merge with his own demonic energy, and attacked the men in black again.

With the blessing of the Life Soul Pearl, Zhu Changlan's demonic energy instantly recovered, even becoming more refined than before. Holding his wooden sword, his figure moved like a ghost among the men in black, with golden demonic energy and golden light intertwining—each strike could kill a man in black. Seeing this, the men in black felt a sense of fear and gradually lost their fighting spirit.

Watching his subordinates fall one by one, the leader in black's eyes flashed with cruelty and despair. He knew it was impossible to seize the pearl today, and if he didn't leave soon, he would die here. "Retreat!" The leader in black roared, turning to flee.

"Want to leave? It's too late!" Zhu Changlan said coldly, his eyes flashing with determination. He would never let these murderers of villagers escape. Activating his demonic energy, he leaped and chased after the leader in black. His wooden sword condensed the dual power of the pearl and demonic energy, with golden light shining brightly, stabbing fiercely at the leader in black's back.

The leader in black was shocked, hurriedly turning to block. But his power was already inferior to before—he couldn't block Zhu Changlan's attack at all. "Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately pierced the leader in black's chest, and the golden power instantly surged in, strangling his meridians and soul. The leader in black let out a shrill scream, his body gradually turning into a wisp of black smoke, completely dissipating into the air.

After dealing with the leader in black, Zhu Changlan returned to the threshing ground and untied the ropes binding the villagers. "Thank you for saving our lives, Young Master!" The villagers knelt on the ground, kowtowing to thank Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan quickly helped the villagers up, saying: "Please don't be so polite, everyone. Protecting your safety is what I should do." Looking at the villagers' injuries, he felt guilty—if he had noticed the abnormality earlier, the villagers wouldn't have been hurt.

The village chief stepped forward, bowing to Zhu Changlan: "Young Master, if it weren't for you today, we would all have lost our lives. But why were those men in black looking for you? Did you offend someone?"

After a moment of thought, Zhu Changlan said: "Those people are the remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect. They came to me to抢夺 a treasure in my body. Today's incident is my fault for连累ing everyone. From now on, I will send people to guard around the village to ensure your safety."

Upon hearing this, the villagers felt fear but were also very grateful for Zhu Changlan's arrangement. They knew the Black Bone Sect was an evil cult that committed all kinds of atrocities—Zhu Changlan could defeat these men in black, so he must be a highly skilled expert.

Zhu Changlan stayed in the village for a while, comforting the villagers' emotions, leaving some healing pills and silver, and then returned to Qingyun Temple. He knew that after today's incident, the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces would search for him even more frantically—he must quickly enhance the Life Soul Pearl's power to prepare for the upcoming crisis.

Back at Qingyun Temple, Zhu Changlan immediately went to the viewing platform, sat cross-legged, and began practicing. Today, the Life Soul Pearl had protected its master at full strength, consuming a lot of power—he needed to nurture the pearl quickly to restore its power. Following the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Formula," he focused his mind, frantically absorbing heaven and earth spiritual energy and injecting it into the Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian.

As night fell, Qixia Mountain's peak was shrouded in silence. Zhu Changlan was still immersed in his practice, with golden light growing more intense around him. Heaven and earth spiritual energy surged toward him like a tide, swirling around him. The Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian continued to absorb spiritual energy, its golden light growing brighter and emitting increasingly powerful energy.

Not knowing how much time had passed, the sky began to turn pale. Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, a flash of golden light in his eyes before returning to calm. After a night of practice, the Life Soul Pearl's power not only fully recovered but also became stronger than before. He could clearly feel his demonic energy realm had broken through the bottleneck, reaching a new height.

"Your Highness, did you gain anything from last night's practice?" Taoist Priest Xuan Chen's voice came from behind. He had sensed the abnormal surge of heaven and earth spiritual energy from the viewing platform last night, knowing Zhu Changlan was immersed in practice, so he came to check early this morning.

Zhu Changlan stood up, bowing: "Thanks to the Taoist Priest, last night I not only nurtured the pearl well but also broke through the bottleneck in my demonic energy realm."

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen nodded, a hint of approval in his eyes: "Your Highness is naturally intelligent and has the Life Soul Pearl's blessing—breaking through the realm is expected. But Your Highness must remember: the stronger the pearl's power, the more covetous eyes it will attract. Last night, the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces came to抢夺 the pearl, but this is just the beginning. More dangers await Your Highness in the future."

Zhu Changlan's heart tightened: "I understand, Taoist Priest. I will practice diligently to enhance my strength and the pearl's power, protecting the pearl well and never letting the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces succeed in their conspiracy."

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen said: "In addition, Your Highness must act cautiously and not easily reveal your whereabouts. The Black Bone Sect's remaining forces are everywhere with many spies. If they learn your exact location, they will stop at nothing to besiege you."

Zhu Changlan nodded, deeply grateful for Xuan Chen's reminder. He knew Xuan Chen's words were true—from now on, he must be more cautious to protect himself and those around him.

In the following days, Zhu Changlan practiced even more diligently. Besides nurturing the Life Soul Pearl and enhancing his demonic energy, he also began to study the inherited memories of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, searching for records related to the Life Soul Pearl and the Source of Spiritual Veins. He hoped to find methods to guard the Source of Spiritual Veins and counter the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces from these inherited memories.

His efforts paid off. After several days of research, Zhu Changlan finally found some records about the Life Soul Pearl and the Source of Spiritual Veins in the inherited memories. The records stated that the Life Soul Pearl of the Snow Spirit Cat clan was the key to guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins. The Source of Spiritual Veins was the root of heaven and earth spiritual energy, maintaining the balance of all things in the world. If the Source of Spiritual Veins was destroyed, the world would fall into chaos. In ancient times, the ancestors of the Black Bone Sect had coveted the Source of Spiritual Veins, wanting to seize its power to dominate the world, but were ultimately defeated by the ancestors of the Snow Spirit Cat clan and other spiritual demons, sealed deep in the Ten Thousand Demon Cave.

Reading these records, Zhu Changlan suddenly understood. It turned out that历代 leaders of the Black Bone Sect had been coveting the power of the Source of Spiritual Veins, wanting to restart it to dominate the world. After the Black Bone Sect leader's residual soul was eliminated by him, the remaining forces still hadn't given up this conspiracy—they were抢夺 the Life Soul Pearl to use its power to break the ancestors' seal and restart the Source of Spiritual Veins.

Knowing all this, Zhu Changlan's sense of mission grew stronger. As a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan with the Life Soul Pearl, guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins and countering the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces was his inherent mission. He would never let the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces succeed in their conspiracy, nor would he let the world fall into chaos.

One day, the dark guard of the Imperial Guards secretly sent by Zhu Changluo suddenly brought news: the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces had gathered a large number of demons and cultists, heading toward Qixia Mountain. It seemed they intended to besiege Qingyun Temple and抢夺 the Life Soul Pearl.

Upon learning this news, Zhu Changlan's expression immediately grew serious. He never expected the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces to be so疯狂, gathering a large number of people to besiege Qingyun Temple. Qingyun Temple was a Taoist holy land—if it was broken through by the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces, the Taoist priests in the temple and the villagers at the foot of the mountain would all suffer.

Zhu Changlan immediately went to the Hall of Three Pure Ones, found Taoist Priest Xuan Chen, and informed him of the news.

Upon hearing this, Xuan Chen's expression also became serious. After a moment of thought, he said: "Your Highness, the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces have gathered a large number of people this time—they come with ill intentions. Although Qingyun Temple has dozens of Taoist priests, most of them have shallow cultivation and cannot compete with the Black Bone Sect's demons and cultists. It seems we must make preparations to deal with this as soon as possible."

Zhu Changlan nodded: "Taoist Priest, I am willing to lead the Imperial Guards' dark guards and the temple's Taoist priests to set up an ambush at the foot of Qixia Mountain to block the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces from ascending the mountain. But the temple's Taoist priests and the villagers at the foot of the mountain still need you to arrange protection and evacuate them to a safe place as soon as possible."

Xuan Chen said: "Your Highness is right. I will immediately arrange for the temple's Taoist priests to lead the villagers at the foot of the mountain to hide in the secret cave behind Qixia Mountain. Your Highness and the Imperial Guards' dark guards will set up an ambush at the foot of the mountain—be sure to be careful and not fight recklessly. If the situation is not good, immediately withdraw to Qingyun Temple and we'll think of another way."

"I understand," Zhu Changlan said with a bow.

Subsequently, Zhu Changlan and Xuan Chen began to act separately. Xuan Chen gathered the temple's Taoist priests and arranged for them to lead the villagers to evacuate; Zhu Changlan gathered the Imperial Guards' dark guards secretly sent by Zhu Changluo, heading to the foot of Qixia Mountain to set up an ambush.

Beside the official road at the foot of Qixia Mountain, there was a dense forest with dangerous terrain—an excellent place for an ambush. Zhu Changlan led the Imperial Guards' dark guards to the forest, arranging the ambush according to the terrain. He had some dark guards hide on the slopes on both sides of the forest, preparing to throw boulders and arrows; some dark guards hide deep in the forest, preparing for close-range surprise attacks; and he himself, holding his wooden sword, hid behind a boulder at the entrance of the forest, waiting for the arrival of the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces.

Before long, a dense sound of footsteps and demonic roars came from the distance. Zhu Changlan peeked out and saw a large number of cultists in black clothes and demons of various shapes coming along the official road toward Qixia Mountain. Leading them was a person in a black robe wearing a skull mask, surrounded by a thick black qi with strong demonic energy—obviously the new leader of the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces.

"Brothers, speed up! As long as we capture Zhu Changlan and seize the Life Soul Pearl, we can restart the Source of Spiritual Veins and dominate the world!" The person in the black robe shouted harshly, his voice hoarse and cold.

Upon hearing this, the cultists and demons' morale soared, and they quickened their pace, walking toward the forest.

The moment they entered the ambush circle, Zhu Changlan shouted angrily: "Attack!"

At Zhu Changlan's command, the dark guards on the slopes immediately threw boulders and arrows. Boulders rolled down, slamming into the cultists and demons; arrows shot like rain, accurately hitting many cultists and demons. Caught off guard, the cultists and demons instantly fell into chaos, with screams rising one after another.

"Ambush! Alert!" The person in the black robe roared, his body surging with black qi, condensing into a black barrier to block the falling boulders and arrows. "Zhu Changlan, you dare to set an ambush here! Today I will tear you into pieces!"

Zhu Changlan stepped out from behind the boulder, coldly saying: "Black-robed man, your Black Bone Sect has committed all kinds of atrocities, harming lives and coveting the Source of Spiritual Veins. Today I will wipe you all out to eliminate harm for the people of the world!"

"Wipe us out?" The black-robed man sneered. "Zhu Changlan, you're too naive! Today I've brought so many subordinates—even with your Life Soul Pearl's blessing, you're no match for us! Brothers, attack! Capture Zhu Changlan and seize the pearl!"

At the black-robed man's command, the chaotic cultists and demons immediately calmed down, surrounding Zhu Changlan and the Imperial Guards' dark guards. For a moment, the forest was filled with the clash of swords and shadows, with demonic energy and evil qi intertwined— the battle was extremely fierce.

Zhu Changlan held his wooden sword, leaping into the battlefield, with demonic energy and golden light intertwining around him to form a dazzling light screen. His moves were fierce and precise, each strike carrying an unstoppable force, piercing at the cultists and demons. The Imperial Guards' dark guards were also skilled, fighting with the cultists and demons. Though outnumbered, they showed no sign of retreat.

Watching his subordinates fall one by one, the black-robed man's eyes flashed with cruelty. He leaped toward Zhu Changlan, his hands condensing a thick black qi to form a huge bone knife, slashing fiercely at Zhu Changlan. This strike was extremely powerful, carrying a strong corrosive nature—obviously intended to be fatal.

Zhu Changlan's expression tightened, not daring to be careless at all. He activated his demonic energy and the pearl's power, his wooden sword glowing with bright golden light, meeting the bone knife head-on. "Clang!" A loud noise sounded as golden light and black qi collided, forming a powerful shockwave that spread in all directions. The surrounding trees shook from the shockwave, with debris falling one after another.

Zhu Changlan was sent back several steps by the shockwave, a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth. He could clearly feel that the black-robed man's demonic energy was very strong—even stronger than the previous leader in black. If he fought head-on, he was no match for him.

Seeing this, the black-robed man's eyes flashed with satisfaction: "Zhu Changlan, your power is strong, but you're still no match for me! Hand over the Life Soul Pearl obediently, and I might spare you!"

Zhu Changlan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, his eyes flashing with determination: "You want the pearl? Unless I die!" He knew he couldn't retreat—once he retreated, the pearl would be stolen, and the Source of Spiritual Veins would be in danger.

With that, Zhu Changlan charged at the black-robed man again. He activated the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Formula," exerting the Life Soul Pearl's power to the extreme. The golden light around him became even more dazzling, and his wooden sword also emitted golden light. Instead of fighting head-on with the black-robed man, he used the agility advantage of his Snow Spirit Cat true form, quickly circling around the black-robed man to look for his opening.

Seeing this, the black-robed man felt a surge of irritation. His demonic energy was strong, but he wasn't as agile as Zhu Changlan—he could never hit Zhu Changlan's figure. "You coward! Stop hiding!" The black-robed man roared, his body surging with black qi that spread in all directions, forming a black wall of qi to trap Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan's expression tightened, secretly thinking it was bad. This black wall of qi carried a strong corrosive nature—once trapped, he would be corroded by the evil qi, with unimaginable consequences. He immediately activated his demonic energy and the pearl's power, rushing toward the wall of qi, wanting to break free from its束缚.

But just as he was about to break through the wall of qi, the black-robed man suddenly launched an attack, his bone knife carrying a thick black qi, stabbing fiercely at his chest. Zhu Changlan was shocked, wanting to dodge, but it was too late.

At this critical moment, the Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian once again burst forth with a dazzling golden light. This golden light was more intense and powerful than ever before, instantly surrounding his body to form an extremely solid defensive barrier. At the same time, the golden light contained a powerful attack power, retaliating against the black-robed man.

"Clang!" The bone knife struck the barrier, emitting a loud noise, and was instantly bounced back. The black-robed man was sent flying by the golden light's retaliatory power, falling heavily to the ground, vomiting blood, with his black robe torn by the golden light, revealing his ferocious face inside.

"What... what kind of power is this?" The black-robed man's eyes flashed with shock and fear. He never expected that the Life Soul Pearl within Zhu Changlan's body would have such powerful strength.

Zhu Changlan was also stunned. He could clearly feel that the Life Soul Pearl was continuously transmitting power to him—his demonic energy was rapidly recovering, even becoming stronger than before. He knew this was the Life Soul Pearl fully protecting its master, the true manifestation of the pearl's power.

A fierce light flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes. No longer hesitating, he immediately charged at the black-robed man. His wooden sword condensed the dual power of the pearl and demonic energy, with golden light shining brightly, stabbing fiercely at the black-robed man's chest.

The black-robed man was shocked, wanting to get up and dodge, but it was too late. "Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately pierced the black-robed man's chest, and the golden power instantly surged in, strangling his meridians and soul. The black-robed man let out a shrill scream, his body gradually turning into a wisp of black smoke, completely dissipating into the air.

After dealing with the black-robed man, Zhu Changlan turned to look at the battlefield. Without their leader's command, the Black Bone Sect's cultists and demons instantly fell into chaos, their morale plummeting. Seeing this, the Imperial Guards' dark guards' morale soared, launching a fierce attack on the cultists and demons.

After a long battle, the Black Bone Sect's cultists and demons were finally completely eliminated. The forest was in a mess, with corpses and blood everywhere, and the air filled with a strong smell of blood and evil qi.

Looking at the scene before him, Zhu Changlan felt extremely tired. He walked to a big tree, sat cross-legged, and began to regulate his breathing. The Life Soul Pearl had fully protected its master, consuming a lot of power—he needed to nurture the pearl quickly to recover his demonic energy.

Before long, Taoist Priest Xuan Chen led the temple's Taoist priests and villagers out from behind the mountain. Seeing the scene in the forest, they were filled with shock and gratitude. "Your Highness, thank you for saving us, protecting Qingyun Temple and the villagers' lives!" Taoist Priest Xuan Chen bowed to thank Zhu Changlan.

The villagers also knelt on the ground, kowtowing to thank Zhu Changlan: "Thank you for saving our lives, Young Master!"

Zhu Changlan stood up, helping the villagers up: "Please don't be so polite, everyone. Protecting your safety is what I should do. The Black Bone Sect's remaining forces have been completely eliminated—from now on, everyone can live in peace."

Upon hearing this, the villagers breathed a sigh of relief, their faces showing relieved smiles. They knew they no longer had to worry about being harmed by the Black Bone Sect.

Zhu Changlan, Taoist Priest Xuan Chen, and others together cleaned up the corpses and blood in the forest, completely erasing the traces of the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces. Then they returned to Qingyun Temple.

Back at Qingyun Temple, Zhu Changlan went to the viewing platform again, sitting cross-legged to nurture the Life Soul Pearl. After this battle, the Life Soul Pearl's power not only didn't weaken but was further awakened and enhanced because it had fully protected its master. He could clearly feel that his connection with the pearl was even closer, and the pearl's power became more得心应手.

As night fell, Zhu Changlan was still immersed in his practice. He knew that although the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces had been eliminated, this didn't mean the crisis was over. There were still many forces and demons in the world coveting the Source of Spiritual Veins and the Life Soul Pearl—he must quickly enhance his and the pearl's power to prepare for future crises.

A few days later, an envoy sent by Zhu Changluo arrived at Qingyun Temple. The envoy brought a letter from Zhu Changluo and an imperial edict from the emperor. The imperial edict stated that Zhu Changlan had defeated the Black Bone Sect's remaining forces at Qixia Mountain, protecting Qingyun Temple and the villagers' lives, and had made great achievements. He was specially conferred the title of "Spiritual Vein Guardian Envoy," given ten thousand taels of gold and a thousand bolts of brocade, and allowed to continue resting at Qingyun Temple while being responsible for guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins and resisting all forces and demons coveting the Source of Spiritual Veins.

Looking at the emperor's imperial edict, Zhu Changlan felt no joy, only calm. He knew that the emperor had conferred him the title of "Spiritual Vein Guardian Envoy" not out of genuine desire to reward him, but to use his and the Life Soul Pearl's power to guard the Source of Spiritual Veins and maintain the dynasty's stability. He was already accustomed to the royal family's coldness and scheming.

In Zhu Changluo's letter, he instructed Zhu Changlan to rest and practice at ease in Qingyun Temple, enhancing his strength and the pearl's power while also paying attention to safety. Zhu Changluo also said he had made arrangements in the capital—if Zhu Changlan encountered any difficulties, he only needed to send someone with a message, and he would immediately send someone to support him.

Reading the letter, Zhu Changlan felt a warm current in his heart. In this cold world, only Zhu Changluo had always stood by him and treated him sincerely. He picked up his brush to reply, telling Zhu Changluo that everything was well in Qingyun Temple and that the Life Soul Pearl's power had been further enhanced, so he didn't need to worry. At the same time, he also instructed Zhu Changluo to be careful in the capital, guard against treacherous officials, and protect his own safety.

After the envoy left, Zhu Changlan continued to rest and practice at Qingyun Temple. Every day, besides nurturing the Life Soul Pearl and enhancing his demonic energy, he studied the inherited memories of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, searching for methods to guard the Source of Spiritual Veins. He knew that as the "Spiritual Vein Guardian Envoy" and a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins was his inherent mission.

Days passed, and both Zhu Changlan's strength and the Life Soul Pearl's power continued to improve. He got along very well with the Taoist priests at Qingyun Temple and established deep feelings with the villagers at the foot of the mountain. He gradually adapted to life here, and his heart gradually calmed down.

But he also knew that this peace was only temporary. The crisis of the Source of Spiritual Veins had not been completely resolved, and there were still many forces and demons in the world coveting the Source of Spiritual Veins and the Life Soul Pearl. He must always be vigilant and prepared for crises.

One day, after finishing his practice, Zhu Changlan went alone to the viewing platform at the top of Qixia Mountain. Standing on the viewing platform, he looked at the distant capital, a complex expression flashing in his eyes. He missed Zhu Changluo and those who treated him sincerely, but he was also tired of the royal court's conflicts and scheming. He didn't know when he would be able to truly escape the conflicts and live a peaceful and stable life.

Just then, the Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian suddenly trembled slightly, emitting a faint golden light. Zhu Changlan was shocked, quickly focusing his mind to sense it. He could clearly feel that the pearl was transmitting a dangerous signal to him—this signal came from the direction of the Source of Spiritual Veins, indicating that the Source of Spiritual Veins was in danger.

Zhu Changlan's expression instantly became serious. He knew that the Source of Spiritual Veins was the root of heaven and earth spiritual energy—if the Source of Spiritual Veins was in danger, the world would fall into chaos. He must immediately go to the Source of Spiritual Veins to investigate the situation and protect it.

Zhu Changlan immediately returned to Qingyun Temple to bid farewell to Taoist Priest Xuan Chen. "Taoist Priest, the Source of Spiritual Veins is sending a dangerous signal. I must immediately go to investigate and protect the Source of Spiritual Veins."

Upon hearing this, Xuan Chen's expression also became serious. "Your Highness, the Source of Spiritual Veins is extremely dangerous. You must be careful when you go there. I have a protective amulet here—the treasure of Qingyun Temple, which can resist evil qi and protect you. Take it with you; it might help you." With that, Xuan Chen took out a crystal-clear jade pendant from his bosom and handed it to Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan accepted the jade pendant, filled with gratitude: "Thank you for your generous gift, Taoist Priest. I will take good care of it. I don't know when I will return from this trip. Qingyun Temple and the villagers at the foot of the mountain will have to rely on you to take care of them."

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen nodded: "Your Highness, don't worry. I will take good care of Qingyun Temple and the villagers. If you encounter any difficulties during your trip to the Source of Spiritual Veins, you can send a message back at any time, and I will do my best to help you."

Zhu Changlan bowed: "Thank you, Taoist Priest. I bid you farewell."

With that, Zhu Changlan turned and left Qingyun Temple, leaping toward the direction of the Source of Spiritual Veins. His figure shuttled through the mountains and forests, like a golden lightning bolt, quickly disappearing into the distance.

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen stood at the mountain gate of Qingyun Temple, looking at Zhu Changlan's departing figure, his eyes filled with worry. He knew that the crisis of the Source of Spiritual Veins must be extremely dangerous, and Zhu Changlan's trip was uncertain. But he also believed that as a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan with the Life Soul Pearl, Zhu Changlan would definitely be able to guard the Source of Spiritual Veins and resolve the crisis.

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Palace in the capital, Zhu Changluo received a letter sent by Zhu Changlan. In the letter, Zhu Changlan informed Zhu Changluo that the Source of Spiritual Veins was sending a dangerous signal and that he had gone to investigate, so Zhu Changluo didn't need to worry. After reading the letter, Zhu Changluo was filled with worry. He knew the Source of Spiritual Veins was extremely dangerous—Zhu Changlan would definitely encounter many dangers on this trip. He immediately ordered Eastern Palace elites to be dispatched to the direction of the Source of Spiritual Veins to meet Zhu Changlan and ensure his safety.

Zhu Changlan was unaware of Zhu Changluo's arrangement. He hurried all the way toward the Source of Spiritual Veins. The Life Soul Pearl deep within his dantian continued to tremble slightly, emitting a faint golden light, transmitting a dangerous signal to him. He could clearly feel that danger was approaching— the crisis of the Source of Spiritual Veins was far more serious than he had imagined.

As night fell, Zhu Changlan continued on his way. He used the moonlight to shuttle through the mountains and forests, his speed not slowing down at all. He knew that every moment he delayed, the Source of Spiritual Veins was in more danger. He must hurry to the Source of Spiritual Veins, investigate the situation, and protect it.

After traveling for an unknown amount of time, the sky began to turn pale. Zhu Changlan finally arrived at the location of the Source of Spiritual Veins—the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area deep within the Ten Thousand Demon Cave. This was the most dangerous place in the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, surrounded by a thick mixture of spiritual energy and evil qi, with demon bones and broken stones of various shapes everywhere, and the air filled with a strange aura.

Zhu Changlan concealed his aura, cautiously walking toward the depths of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area. He could clearly feel that the spiritual energy of the Source of Spiritual Veins was continuously flowing away, while the evil qi was continuously growing. Obviously, someone was destroying the Source of Spiritual Veins, wanting to seize its power.

When he reached the core area of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, he finally saw the person destroying the Source of Spiritual Veins. A man in white clothes with a handsome face stood beside the spring eye of the Source of Spiritual Veins, his hands condensing a thick evil qi, injecting it fiercely into the spring eye. The spring eye of the Source of Spiritual Veins was continuously bubbling, with spiritual energy flowing away along with the injection of evil qi, and the color of the spring eye was gradually turning black.

"Who are you? How dare you destroy the Source of Spiritual Veins!" Zhu Changlan shouted angrily, stepping out from the shadows. He could clearly feel that this man in white had very strong demonic energy and extremely pure evil qi—obviously a demon who had cultivated for many years.

The man in white turned around, looking at Zhu Changlan, a hint of surprise in his eyes followed by understanding. "You must be Zhu Changlan? A descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan and the Spiritual Vein Guardian Envoy with the Life Soul Pearl?"

Zhu Changlan said coldly: "It's me. Who exactly are you? Why are you destroying the Source of Spiritual Veins?"

The man in white smiled: "Who I am is not something you need to know. I'm destroying the Source of Spiritual Veins naturally to seize its power. The Source of Spiritual Veins is the root of heaven and earth spiritual energy—if I can seize its power, I can break through my realm and dominate the world!" He paused, his eyes flashing with greed. "Moreover, your Life Soul Pearl is the key to guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins. As long as I can seize your Life Soul Pearl and merge it with the power of the Source of Spiritual Veins, I can become the most powerful existence in the world!"

Zhu Changlan's expression darkened, filled with anger. He never expected this man in white to also covet the Source of Spiritual Veins and the Life Soul Pearl, wanting to dominate the world. He would never let this man in white's conspiracy succeed.

"Wishful thinking!" Zhu Changlan shouted angrily, his demonic energy and golden light intertwining to form a dazzling light screen. Holding his wooden sword, he charged at the man in white.

The man in white saw this, a hint of disdain in his eyes. "With your little strength, you want to stop me? That's simply overestimating yourself!" His body surged with evil qi, condensing into a black barrier to block Zhu Changlan's attack.
