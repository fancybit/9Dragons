Chapter 9: Fish Dried as Bait, Initial Clues Revealed

Year 25 of the Wanli Reign, early summer.

The morning light of Xian'an Palace, wrapped in the fresh fragrance of newly sprouted osmanthus leaves, filtered through the layered branches, weaving细碎的 light spots on the bluestone slabs, like scattered broken diamonds. Zhu Changlan sat at the stone table in the courtyard, a piece of golden, translucent fish dried between his fingertips. A rich, salty aroma lingered at the tip of his nose—this was specially ordered by him to be dried by Xiaoluzi. It was made from the plumpest silver fish from the imperial river, scaled and gutted, then carefully rubbed with coarse salt, marinated for three hours to remove the fishy smell, then placed on a well-ventilated bamboo tray to dry for three days, repeatedly turned over during the period until the fish meat shrank tightly, exuding a faint salt frost, with the unique sweetness of river fish when bitten open.

"Your Highness, try this batch? I guarantee it's more to your taste than last time!" Xiaoluzi came quickly with a carved wooden plate. The neatly arranged fish dried on the plate glowed with an enticing luster, and he had a simple, honest smile on his face, "I specially went to the Eastern Palace imperial kitchen to learn a trick. I added half a spoonful of flower honey to neutralize the saltiness when marinating, and put a thin layer of gauze to keep dust off when drying. It retains the fish fragrance without any impurities."

Zhu Changlan picked up a piece and put it in his mouth. The moment his teeth bit down, the firmness and chewiness of the fish meat instantly spread, the salty aroma spreading along his tongue, with a faint sweetness at the end, becoming more flavorful the more he chewed. He slowly nodded, a trace of satisfaction flashing in his eyes: "It's indeed improved, more mellow than last time."

Xiaoluzi straightened his back after receiving the praise: "Of course! Since Your Highness likes it, I'll keep thinking of ways to make it better."

Zhu Changlan smiled, his fingertips caressing the texture of the fish dried, but his gaze drifted to the courtyard gate, a hint of depth hidden in his eyes. Since Qingyun Temple sent news that the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul had fled to the Ten Thousand Mountains in the southern border, he hadn't dared to slack off for a single day. At first, the Crown Prince refused to let him go personally, fearing his newly recovered body couldn't handle the journey, let alone the unpredictable dangers of the Ten Thousand Mountains. But he persisted in soft and hard ways, and finally the Crown Prince relented, not only sending 20 elite Jinyiwei dark guards to accompany him, but also asking Daoist Xuanchen of Qingyun Temple to bring five disciples along, saying it would be more照应.

With departure imminent, what troubled him most was how to find that cunning remnant soul in the Ten Thousand Mountains. The place was mountainous and densely forested, with thick demon qi, making ordinary detection methods useless. Moreover, the Black Bone Sect leader had always been good at concealing his aura, escaping at the slightest movement. Just when he was frowning, he suddenly remembered his Snow Spirit Cat true form—Snow Spirit Cats are naturally sensitive to fishy smells, while Black Bone Sect demons, who have long吸食ed the blood of living beings, are bound to carry an unshakable bloody scent. The combination of these two scents might form a unique "bait," luring those demons to reveal themselves. That's why he asked Xiaoluzi to make a large batch of fish dried, planning to use it as bait to lure enemies.

"Xiaoluzi, put all these fish dried into earthen pots, lined with oil paper, don't let moisture get in." Zhu Changlan withdrew his gaze, instructing in a deep voice, "Also prepare several pieces of clean oil paper cloth, they'll be useful on the road."

"Yes, right away!" Xiaoluzi quickly responded, holding the wooden plate and turning to get busy.

Zhu Changlan stood up, walking to the center of the courtyard, and raised his hand to pick up the阴沉木 sword. The sword glowed with a warm black sheen in the morning light, cool but not cold to the touch, specially ground by the Crown Prince according to his hand shape. He gently rotated his wrist, the sword cutting through the air, bringing a sharp wind whistle. A faint golden demon power flowed along the sword, condensing into a spot of light at the tip. After several days of hard practice, his demon power had recovered more than 70%, his meridians becoming more unobstructed under the nourishment of elixirs, and his moves becoming more rounded, no longer as awkward as before. He had confidence that even if he encountered Black Bone Sect remnants, he could handle them freely.

I. Departure for Southern Border: Long Road Ahead, Hidden Killers

Three days later, at dawn, Zhu Changlan and his group set off for the southern border.

The Crown Prince personally came to the palace gate to see them off, his clear eyebrows made more gentle by his bright yellow robe, but his eyes looking at Zhu Changlan couldn't hide worry and reluctance. "Ninth Brother, the journey to the southern border is long. Put your own safety first, never push yourself too hard." He stepped forward, personally adjusting the reins on Zhu Changlan's saddle, "If you encounter danger, don't force yourself. Send someone back to the capital immediately, and I'll dispatch southern border garrisons to support you right away."

Zhu Changlan turned over and mounted his horse, reining in the reins and bowing: "Don't worry, Elder Brother. I know what to do. As for matters in the capital, I'll trouble you to take care of them. Although the remnants of Consort Zheng and the Third Prince have been cleared, the undercurrents in the court haven't subsided. You must be more cautious."

"I know." The Crown Prince nodded, taking a red sandalwood brocade box from his sleeve and handing it to Zhu Changlan, "Inside is the military talisman Father gave me, with this you can mobilize garrisons from all states in the southern border. Take it with you, it might come in handy at critical moments."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade box with both hands, feeling its heaviness, and carefully tucked it into his inner chest pocket: "Thank you, Elder Brother."

"And this." The Crown Prince passed a small pear wood medicine box, "Inside are golden sore medicine, detoxification pills specially made by the imperial hospital, and calming talismans personally drawn by Daoist Xuanqing, which can dispel evil qi and stabilize spiritual consciousness. Keep it close to you, never lose it."

Zhu Changlan took the medicine box, the warmth of the box touching his fingertips, a warm current surging in his heart: "Elder Brother, you also take care. After I eliminate the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, I'll return to the capital as soon as possible."

The Crown Prince waved his hand, his eyes full of expectation: "Go, have a safe journey."

Zhu Changlan turned his horse around, his gaze sweeping over the Jinyiwei dark guards and Qingyun Temple disciples behind him, his voice deep: "Let's go!"

The sound of hooves broke through the morning mist, and the group galloped along the official road towards the southern border. Daoist Xuanchen rode a black horse, side by side with Zhu Changlan. He wore a cyan Taoist robe, a peach wood sword hanging at his waist, his expression grave: "Ninth Prince, the Ten Thousand Mountains have long been known as a 'demon cave.' Not only is the demon qi thick, but there are also countless wild beasts and cultivated demons. Not to mention the Black Bone Sect remnants hiding there. This trip is extremely dangerous."

"I know." Zhu Changlan looked ahead, his voice calm but firm, "But as long as the Black Bone Sect is not eliminated, the human world will never be at peace, and my Elder Brother and the spiritual vein source will always be in danger. No matter how dangerous the road ahead is, I must go." He turned his head to look at Daoist Xuanchen, nodding slightly, "This trip to the southern border, I'll have to trouble Daoist and all senior brothers."

"Your Highness, you're too polite." Daoist Xuanchen clasped his hands, "Protecting the righteous path of the human world is the responsibility of Qingyun Temple. It's my honor to eliminate demons with Your Highness."

The group traveled south all the way. The closer they got to the southern border, the hotter and more humid the climate became. The trees along the official road gradually changed to tall banyan trees and camphor trees, their leaves so dense they blocked the sky, sunlight only leaking through gaps, casting scattered light spots on the moss-covered road. The air was filled with a strong smell of grass and trees and moisture, making people feel sticky even when inhaled. Many Jinyiwei dark guards frowned slightly.

After five days of travel, the group officially entered the southern border. Unlike the flatness of the Central Plains, the terrain here was full of rolling hills and winding mountain roads. The official road became rugged and narrow, making it very difficult for horses to walk. The villages along the way were sparse, occasionally seeing a few villagers in indigo cloth turbans, their eyes wary as they looked at the group. When they saw Zhu Changlan and others dressed in fine clothes, they quickly avoided, showing a sense of alienation that strangers should not enter.

"Your Highness, there's a Black Wind Forest three li ahead, filled with miasma. Why don't we rest here, let the horses catch their breath, and let the brothers drink some water to relieve the heat?" The Jinyiwei dark guard commander rode forward, reporting in a low voice. He had been on missions abroad all year round and had some understanding of the southern border terrain.

Zhu Changlan reined in his horse, looking ahead. Not far away, the forest was dark and black, with faint gray-black miasma entangled among the treetops, faintly exuding an ominous evil aura. He nodded: "Good, rest here. Daoist Xuanchen, please take two senior brothers to investigate the situation in Black Wind Forest, pay attention to whether there's demon qi and ambushes."

"Yes." Daoist Xuanchen responded, then called two disciples, dismounted, and walked briskly towards Black Wind Forest. They moved quickly, soon disappearing at the edge of the dense forest.

Zhu Changlan and others dismounted one after another, tying their horses to the old banyan trees by the roadside. Xiaoluzi quickly took out water bags and pastries from the baggage, distributing them to everyone one by one: "Your Highness, try this mung bean cake. It's specially made by the Eastern Palace small kitchen, with mint added, clearing heat and relieving summer heat."

Zhu Changlan took the mung bean cake, took a bite, and the cool, sweet taste instantly dispelled some of the summer heat. He looked at the Black Wind Forest not far away, his eyes full of vigilance. The miasma in that forest was mixed with a faint demon qi, far from ordinary miasma. It was likely that there were demons盘踞ing inside, perhaps the hiding place of Black Bone Sect remnants.

About the time it takes to burn an incense stick, Daoist Xuanchen returned with his disciples, his expression even more grave than before: "Your Highness, the Black Wind Forest is filled with thick demon qi, and there are obvious traces of Black Bone Sect demons' activities. We found a hidden cave deep in the forest, the entrance covered by vines, with thick evil qi wrapped around the vines, and faint sounds of demons wriggling inside. There must be many demons gathered inside."

Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, standing up, gripping the wooden sword in his hand: "It seems we found the right place. Daoist Xuanchen, take your disciples and the Jinyiwei dark guards to set up defenses and respond from the periphery. I'll go to the cave to investigate."

"No!" Daoist Xuanchen quickly stopped him, "The situation in the cave is unknown, and the demon qi is strong. It's too dangerous for Your Highness to go alone. Why don't let me go in with Your Highness,也好有个照应."

"No need." Zhu Changlan shook his head, his tone firm, "The cave is narrow, two people going together would be inconvenient to move. I have my own self-protection methods. You respond from the periphery, and come in to support immediately once you hear any movement from inside the cave." He paused, taking a clay pot from his baggage, pulling out the stopper. A strong fish dried fragrance instantly spread, "This fish dried is the bait I prepared. I'll put it at the cave entrance, lure the demons inside out, and then take the opportunity to investigate the cave situation."

Seeing his firm attitude, Daoist Xuanchen knew he couldn't stop him, so he nodded: "Your Highness must be careful. If you encounter danger, immediately crush this signal talisman." With that, he handed over a yellow talisman.

Zhu Changlan took the talisman and put it away: "Thank you, Daoist." With that, he carried the clay pot, his steps light as a cat, walking towards the depths of Black Wind Forest.

II. Fish Dried Luring Enemies: Demons Revealed, Initial Clues

In the depths of Black Wind Forest, the light became dimmer. Tall trees intertwined and tangled, only leaking a few scattered light spots through the branches. The demon qi in the air became thicker and thicker, mixed with the stench of rotting meat and the bitterness of miasma, making people's throats tight. Zhu Changlan circulated his demon power, forming a thin shield around his body, isolating part of the evil qi, while收敛 his own aura, his steps light as a cat, silently moving towards the cave direction.

The cave was hidden in a depression in the mountain wall, the entrance tightly covered by dense blood-red vines. The edges of the vine leaves were sharp thorns, with some dry animal fur hanging on them, clearly traces left by creatures that were entangled and torn in the past. Around the cave entrance scattered many incomplete animal bones, covered with a faint black qi. When fingers approached, you could feel a piercing chill—this was the residual evil qi after being吸食ed the blood by demons.

Zhu Changlan walked around to the side of the cave, behind an ancient banyan tree, carefully observing the cave entrance from the cover of the tree trunk. After confirming there were no other ambushes, he carried the clay pot, tiptoeing to a rock not far from the cave entrance, pouring most of the fish dried onto the rock, then quickly retreating behind the banyan tree, holding his breath, staring intently at the cave entrance.

The rich salty aroma of the fish dried quickly spread in the hot and humid air, mixing with the surrounding demon qi and stench, forming a strange but very tempting smell. Not long after, a "窸窸窣窣" sound came from inside the cave, like countless small claws scratching the stone wall, the sound getting closer and clearer from far away.

Zhu Changlan gripped the wooden sword tightly, his fingertips slightly forceful, his knuckles turning white. He could feel a strong demon qi approaching the cave entrance, its aura turbid and violent, clearly a ferocious demon.

After a while, the blood-red vines at the cave entrance suddenly shook violently, a thick vine being forcibly pushed open from the middle. A demon the size of a water buffalo slowly crawled out. This demon was covered in dark brown hard shells, with spiral protrusions all over the shell, like embedded countless small bone spurs; its head was triangular, a pair of compound eyes glowing with a strange green light, the dense compound eye crystals shining with cold light in the dim light; two curved poison pincers extended from both sides of its mouth, the tips of the pincers glowing dark purple, clearly full of poison; eight thick legs covered with thorns, every move heard the harsh sound of thorns scraping the ground.

This was a cultivated poison pincer centipede! Zhu Changlan understood in his heart. This kind of demon is extremely ferocious by nature, fond of吸食ing the blood of living beings, and is one of the most commonly recruited minions of the Black Bone Sect.

The poison pincer centipede has an extremely sensitive sense of smell. As soon as it crawled out of the cave, it was attracted by the fish dried fragrance on the rock. Its green compound eyes locked onto the rock direction, dragging its heavy body slowly crawling over. Its movements seemed slow, but carried a suffocating sense of oppression, the weeds along the way being crushed to pieces by its hard shell.

Zhu Changlan held his breath, his gaze fixed on the poison pincer centipede's movements. This centipede demon's cultivation was not low, its hard shell was extremely hard, ordinary swords恐怕难以穿透, only the eyes and abdomen were weak points. He planned to wait for the centipede demon to approach the fish dried, relax its vigilance, and then launch a surprise attack, first blinding its eyes, then subduing it, forcing it to reveal the whereabouts of the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul.

Just as the poison pincer centipede's poison pincers were about to touch the fish dried, Zhu Changlan moved! His figure was like a golden lightning bolt, suddenly darting out from behind the banyan tree, his demon power surging all over his body, the wooden sword wrapped in golden demon power, with a sharp sound of breaking air, straight stabbing the poison pincer centipede's compound eyes!

The poison pincer centipede clearly didn't expect an ambush, its green compound eyes suddenly contracting, instinctively waving the front poison pincers towards the wooden sword. "Dang!" A harsh metal collision sound, sparks flying. The wooden sword hit the poison pincers hard, but was slightly rebounded, while only a shallow white mark was left on the poison pincer centipede's poison pincers.

"Hiss------" The poison pincer centipede was enraged, making a sharp hissing sound, the black qi around its body suddenly surging, eight spiny legs suddenly kicked the ground, its huge body fiercely crashing towards Zhu Changlan, the poison pincers waving,带着浓烈的 poisonous gas, clamping towards Zhu Changlan's head.

Zhu Changlan's eyes condensed, his steps suddenly retreating sharply, while his wrist flipped, the wooden sword drawing an arc, blocking the attack of the poison pincers. The poisonous gas rushed towards him, blocked by his demon power shield, not harming him. He used the retreating force to suddenly side-step, avoiding the charge of the poison pincer centipede, while the wooden sword顺势 downward, with golden demon power, stabbing towards the poison pincer centipede's soft abdomen!

"Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately pierced the poison pincer centipede's abdomen, dark green blood instantly gushing out,带着 a pungent stench. The poison pincer centipede made a shrill scream, its huge body violently twitching, black qi surging from the wound, clearly its demon power rapidly collapsing.

Zhu Changlan showed no mercy, gripping the wooden sword, circulating demon power again, golden demon power pouring into the poison pincer centipede's body along the sword,疯狂 destroying its meridians and demon core. The poison pincer centipede's twitching became weaker and weaker, its green compound eyes gradually losing their luster, finally completely fixed, its huge body crashing to the ground, no longer moving.

Zhu Changlan pulled out the wooden sword, shaking off the dark green blood on the sword, his brows slightly furrowed. This poison pincer centipede's cultivation was already not low, but it was just a bottom-level minion of the Black Bone Sect. Presumably, there must be stronger demons in the cave. He didn't rush into the cave, but turned back to the forest, telling Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards about the situation inside the cave.

"Your Highness, it seems the cave in Black Wind Forest is indeed a Black Bone Sect stronghold." Daoist Xuanchen said after hearing, his expression grave, "This kind of poison pincer centipede needs at least a hundred years to cultivate to this level. To be able to command such demons, the demon leader inside the cave must be extraordinary."

"Hmm." Zhu Changlan nodded, "This is just a small minion, the real core members are still in the cave. Charging in recklessly is too risky. It's better to continue using fish dried as bait, lure the demons inside out, then take the opportunity to wipe them out, and then enter the cave to investigate."

"Your Highness's method is excellent." Daoist Xuanchen agreed, "These demons are greedy by nature, the fish dried fragrance will definitely lure them all out. We can set up an ambush around the cave entrance, and once the demons come out, annihilate them all at once."

"Good." Zhu Changlan responded, then took out the remaining fish dried from his baggage, distributing them to the Jinyiwei dark guards and Qingyun Temple disciples, "You place the fish dried on the rocks, branches around the cave entrance, then hide in the dark to ambush. Qingyun Temple senior brothers prepare talismans, Jinyiwei dark guards guard each exit. Once the demons come out, immediately take action."

Everyone received the order, carrying fish dried, silently moving towards the cave direction. They moved quickly, soon finishing placing the fish dried, then hid behind the surrounding trees and rocks, gripping their weapons, concentrating on guarding.

Zhu Changlan hid behind the original banyan tree, the wooden sword held horizontally in front of him, his eyes focused on the cave entrance. He could clearly feel that the demon qi inside the cave was becoming more and more restless, obviously the demons inside were attracted by the fish dried fragrance, gathering towards the cave entrance.

About half an incense stick later, a dense "窸窣" sound came from inside the cave, louder than when the poison pincer centipede came out. The blood-red vines at the cave entrance shook violently, followed by demons crawling out one after another—some were winged blood-sucking bat demons, wings spread two meters wide, fangs exposed; some were wolf demons covered in black fur, eyes glowing with bloodthirsty red light; others were sturdy toad demons, skin covered with poison sacs, crawling step by step, leaving behind pools of white-smoking venom.

"Attack!" Zhu Changlan shouted in a low voice, charging out first. The wooden sword, with golden demon power, was like a streamer, straight stabbing the head of a wolf demon in front.

Daoist Xuanchen and his disciples also attacked simultaneously, several golden talismans flying from their hands, turning into golden light in the air, shooting towards the demons. "Boom! Boom!" The talismans exploded among the demons, golden flames bursting, many smaller bat demons instantly burned to ashes.

The Jinyiwei dark guards also rushed out one after another, their steel knives glowing cold, fighting with the demons. For a moment, the Black Wind Forest was filled with killing sounds, the roar of demons, the collision of swords, the explosion of talismans交织在一起, resounding through the sky.

Zhu Changlan's figure flexibly shuttled among the demons, the wooden sword waving densely. These demons were ferocious, Zhu Changlan didn't hold back, every sword stabbing towards the demons' vital points. Golden demon power flowed along the sword, burning black holes in the demons' bodies when touching their bodies, making the demons roar in pain. A bat demon俯冲而下 from the air, biting towards his neck. Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, his wrist suddenly flipping, the wooden sword picking backward, accurately piercing the bat demon's wing, then kicking it away, crashing into a tree trunk, twitching a few times and losing its breath.

Daoist Xuanchen held a peach wood sword, chanting incantations, the peach wood sword glowing with faint golden light, every swing splitting a mass of demon qi. His disciples formed a sword formation, talismans and sword light cooperating with each other, killing demons one by one. The Jinyiwei dark guards cooperated tacitly, three people in a group, offense and defense orderly, every swing of the steel knife causing a demon to fall.

The battle lasted for nearly an hour until the sun was setting, the demons at the cave entrance were finally completely cleared. The ground was covered with demon bodies, green, black blood dyed the ground, the air filled with a strong smell of blood and stench, making people nauseous.

Zhu Changlan leaned on the wooden sword, slightly panting, sweat dripping from his forehead, soaking his front. His clothes were stained with a lot of demon blood, his combat outfit cut by demon claws in several places, revealing faint scars, but his eyes were still firm. After this battle, his demon power consumed a lot, but it operated more condensed than before, his state of mind becoming more calm.

"Your Highness, are you okay?" Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, handing Zhu Changlan a bottle of healing pills, concerned.

"I'm fine." Zhu Changlan took the pills, poured out one and took it, shaking his head, "These are just Black Bone Sect's peripheral members, the real core is still in the cave. Let's rest for half an hour, replenish our strength, then enter the cave to investigate."

III. Cave Exploration: Black Qi Diffuse, Hidden Mysteries

Everyone rested simply outside the forest for half an hour, drinking some water, eating some dry food, replenishing their strength. After taking the pills, Zhu Changlan's minor injuries had basically healed, and his demon power had recovered about 30-40%.

After resting, the group walked towards the cave. At this time, the vines at the cave entrance had been shattered by the aftershocks of the battle, revealing a dark cave entrance, like a giant mouth choosing to devour people. The cave was filled with thick black qi, mixed with blood and stench, several times stronger than outside. Just approaching the cave entrance made people feel difficult to breathe.

"Everyone be careful, the black qi inside the cave is thick, there may be evil traps. Follow my steps, don't touch anything inside the cave." Zhu Changlan warned, then circulated his demon power, his cat's-eye stone glowing with a faint blue light, illuminating the road ahead. He walked into the cave first, followed by Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards.

The inside of the cave was much more complicated than imagined. The entrance was narrow, only allowing one person to pass. After walking about ten steps, the cave suddenly became spacious, forming a winding passage. The cave walls were covered with wet dark green moss, touching with fingertips would stick to a layer of sticky juice, emitting a faint fishy smell. On both sides of the passage, there were occasional grooves carved with strange patterns, with faint black qi remaining in the grooves, obviously traces left by demons practicing evil techniques before.

The further they went into the cave, the thicker the black qi became, and the pressure became stronger and stronger. Zhu Changlan could feel that the surrounding evil qi was constantly eroding his demon power shield. If it weren't for the calming talismans protecting his spiritual consciousness, he would have been affected by the evil qi and become manic.

After walking for nearly an hour, the passage ahead suddenly opened up, forming a huge stone chamber. The stone chamber was about三丈 high, with many stalactites hanging from the top, water droplets dripping from the stalactites, making "tick-tock" sounds that were particularly clear in the silent stone chamber. In the center of the stone chamber stood a half-human-high black altar, made of unknown black stone, surface carved with twisted runes, dense black qi lingering between the runes. On the altar were three skull ritual tools, with flickering green flames in the eye sockets, emitting a palpitating evil qi.

Around the altar, scattered many human skeletons, incomplete, obviously cruelly tortured and killed by demons, then吸食ed their blood. In the four corners of the stone chamber,蜷缩ed a huge demon, covered with thick black qi, like four black clouds. When they heard the sound, they slowly raised their heads, revealing their ferocious faces.

"It's you damn humans again, daring to break in and ruin the教主's great plan!" The demon in the left corner slowly stood up, the size of a yellow cow, covered with gray mane, its head a huge wild boar's head, two curved tusks glowing with cold light, its eyes fierce as it stared at Zhu Changlan and the others, its voice rough as a broken gong, shaking the stone chamber slightly.

Zhu Changlan's eyes darkened: "Is your教主 the Black Bone Sect leader? Where is he now?"

"Hmph, the whereabouts of the教主, how can I tell you lowly humans!" The wild boar demon roared, suddenly rushing towards Zhu Changlan, huge pig hooves stepping on the ground, making "dong-dong" sounds. The black qi around its body condensed into a huge bone knife, slashing towards Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan didn't dare to be careless, gripping the wooden sword, circulating demon power, golden demon power flowing along the sword, slashing towards the bone knife. "Dang!" A loud sound, the wooden sword collided with the bone knife, golden demon power and black evil qi clashing with each other, forming a strong air wave, spreading around. Zhu Changlan only felt his arm numb, his body being shaken back three steps before stabilizing, secretly shocked: This wild boar demon's strength is so strong, its cultivation is more than one level higher than the previous poison pincer centipede, clearly a core member of the Black Bone Sect.

At the same time, the other three demons also stood up to attack. A fox demon with a snake tail swung its claws, pouncing towards the Qingyun Temple disciples; a huge stone armor monster, covered with hard rocks, charged towards the Jinyiwei dark guards; a winged crow demon hovered in the air, occasionally making shrill screams, trying to disturb everyone's minds.

Seeing this, Daoist Xuanchen quickly shouted: "Disciples, form a formation to defend! Jinyiwei dark guard commander, lead people to entangle the stone armor monster!" With that, he held the peach wood sword, rushing towards the fox demon, the peach wood sword glowing with golden light, blocking the fox demon's attack.

The stone chamber immediately fell into chaos. Zhu Changlan fought with the wild boar demon, who had great strength, every swing of the bone knife carrying a devastating momentum. Zhu Changlan could only rely on his flexible body to keep avoiding, looking for opportunities to counterattack. He found that although the wild boar demon was strong, its movements were slightly slow, and its eyes were easily provoked. As long as it was provoked, it would reveal its flaws.

"Coward who only knows how to hide!" The wild boar demon, seeing its attacks repeatedly miss, roared, the black qi around its body surging, the bone knife becoming even larger, "Today I'll tear you into pieces, sacrifice you to our教's ritual tools!"

It suddenly charged forward, the bone knife slashing heavily towards Zhu Changlan's head. Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, no longer hiding, but circulating all his demon power, the wooden sword fully wrapped in golden demon power. He kicked the ground, his body leaping upward, avoiding the bone knife while the wooden sword, with sharp edge, stabbed towards the wild boar demon's left eye!

The wild boar demon didn't expect Zhu Changlan to suddenly counterattack, its pupils suddenly contracting, trying to turn its head to avoid, but it was too late. "Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately stabbed into the wild boar demon's left eye, dark green blood gushing out. The wild boar demon let out a heart-piercing scream, the pain making it completely lose its mind, crazily waving the bone knife, slashing around randomly.

Zhu Changlan used the jumping force, flipping in the air, landing steadily on the ground. He didn't give the wild boar demon a chance to breathe, his steps错开, rushing forward again, the wooden sword avoiding the crazily waving bone knife, stabbing towards the wild boar demon's neck. At this time, the wild boar demon was completely out of control, unable to distinguish directions. The wooden sword easily stabbed into its neck, golden demon power instantly pouring in, crazily destroying its demon core.

"Ouch------" The wild boar demon let out a final shrill scream, huge body crashing to the ground, twitching a few times and losing its breath, the black qi around its body gradually dissipating.

After dealing with the wild boar demon, Zhu Changlan turned to look at other battlefields. Daoist Xuanchen had already killed the fox demon, and was leading his disciples to assist the Jinyiwei dark guards in besieging the stone armor monster; the crow demon in the air was entangled by two Jinyiwei dark guards, gradually falling into a disadvantage. Zhu Changlan carried the wooden sword, rushing towards the crow demon, swinging the sword, golden demon power turning into a sword qi, slashing towards the crow demon's wings.

The crow demon screamed, its wings scratched by the sword qi, bleeding profusely, no longer able to maintain flight, falling from the air. The Jinyiwei dark guards took the opportunity to step forward, steel knives coming down together, killing the crow demon.

Only the stone armor monster remained, under the joint attack of Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards, the rock armor on its body was already full of cracks, its aura becoming weaker and weaker. Zhu Changlan stepped forward, the wooden sword with golden demon power, stabbing towards the stone armor monster's head, "puchi" sound, the wooden sword penetrating the rock armor, stabbing into the stone armor monster's head. The stone armor monster let out a dull roar, huge body crashing to the ground, completely motionless.

The battle ended, the stone chamber was in a mess, the ground covered with demon bodies, dark green blood dyed the ground, mixed with human skeletons, making people触目惊心. Zhu Changlan, Daoist Xuanchen and others had all consumed a lot of energy, more or less injured.

"Your Highness, are you okay?" Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, concerned.

"It's okay." Zhu Changlan shook his head, his gaze falling on the black altar in the center, "Let's go see what clues are on the altar."

The two walked to the altar, carefully observing the runes and ritual tools on the altar. Daoist Xuanchen frowned, carefully identifying the runes: "These runes are the Black Bone Sect's 'Yin Gathering Soul Devouring Array,' more sinister than the previous Yin Gathering Array. It can not only absorb surrounding yin qi, but also devour the souls of living beings, converting them into evil qi for cultivators to absorb. It seems that the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul did practice here before."

"Oh?" Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, "Is he still here now?"

"He should have left." Daoist Xuanchen shook his head, "Although the black qi on the altar is thick, it has no fresh breath, obviously not operated for some time. Judging from the dissipation of the black qi, the教主's remnant soul should have left three to five days ago, heading deep into the Ten Thousand Mountains."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his gaze sweeping over the altar, suddenly finding a black token in the corner of the altar. He reached out and picked up the token, which was cold to the touch, carved with the Black Bone Sect's skull symbol, with several strange runes carved under the symbol. "The runes on this token seem to be some kind of contact code." Zhu Changlan said, handing the token to Daoist Xuanchen.

Daoist Xuanchen took the token, looked at it carefully for a moment, nodding: "Your Highness is right, this is a contact token within the Black Bone Sect. Different runes represent different strongholds and contact methods. We can follow the residual breath on the token to track the whereabouts of the Black Bone Sect leader."

"Good." Zhu Changlan put the token away, "This place is not suitable for long stay. Let's leave the cave first, find a safe place to rest for the night, and continue tracking tomorrow according to the breath of the token."

IV. Rest and Tracking: Clues Emerge, Killers Rise Again

The group left the cave, found a flat, open area on the outskirts of Black Wind Forest, setting up temporary tents. Xiaoluzi started a fire to cook hot soup, everyone drank the hot soup, ate dry food, and treated their wounds, then rested separately.

Early the next morning, at dawn, everyone packed their bags, with Daoist Xuanchen holding the black token, following the residual breath on the token, heading deep into the Ten Thousand Mountains.

Deep in the Ten Thousand Mountains, the terrain became more complex, with no decent roads at all, only able to walk艰难ly through dense forests and steep mountain walls. The trees here were taller and stouter, with leaves so dense they blocked the sky, always shrouded in dimness. The demon qi in the air was so thick it was almost tangible, mixed with the smell of rotting meat and miasma, every breath felt painful in the lungs. Along the way, there were animal and human skeletons everywhere, some with broken weapons inserted, obviously adventurers or cultivators who had unfortunately died here.

"Your Highness, look ahead!" Daoist Xuanchen suddenly stopped, pointing to a valley not far away, his voice deep.

Zhu Changlan followed his finger, seeing that the valley ahead was filled with mist, the mist was faintly black, obviously mixed with demon qi and miasma. Black qi churned above the valley, faintly visible many simple wooden house outlines inside, obviously another Black Bone Sect stronghold. More importantly, the breath from the token was heading towards that valley.

"It seems we found the right place." Zhu Changlan's eyes darkened, his voice lowered, "This stronghold is much larger than the cave in Black Wind Forest, there must be many demons inside. Daoist Xuanchen, you take three disciples, go around to the west side of the valley, ambushing on the hillside; the other two disciples follow me, together with the Jinyiwei dark guards, attacking from the front to attract the attention of the demons. After we launch the attack, you俯冲 down from the hillside, attacking from front and back, wiping out all the demons."

"Good!" Daoist Xuanchen responded, immediately taking three disciples, silently going around to the west side of the valley.

Zhu Changlan took two Qingyun Temple disciples and twenty Jinyiwei dark guards, carefully approaching the front of the valley. At the entrance of the valley, stood two huge rocks, forming a natural barrier, with two tall demon guards standing beside the rocks. These two demons had human bodies and leopard heads, covered with yellow fur, holding huge wolf tooth clubs, their eyes vigilantly scanning the surroundings, their bodies covered with thick black qi, obviously with high cultivation.

"Stop! Who are you? How dare you break into Black Wind Valley territory!" The leopard-headed demon on the left saw Zhu Changlan and others, shouting sharply, slamming the wolf tooth club to the ground, making a "dong" sound.

"The one who takes your dog life!" Zhu Changlan shouted coldly, his figure suddenly flashing like a golden lightning bolt, rushing towards the leopard-headed demon on the left. The wooden sword with sharp golden demon power, straight stabbing the leopard-headed demon's chest.

The leopard-headed demon didn't expect Zhu Changlan to suddenly attack, a flash of panic in his eyes, quickly swinging the wolf tooth club to block the wooden sword. "Dang!" The wooden sword collided with the wolf tooth club, sparks flying. The leopard-headed demon only felt his arm go numb, the wolf tooth club almost slipping out of his hand, secretly shocked: This human's strength is so strong!

At the same time, the leopard-headed demon on the right was surrounded by Jinyiwei dark guards, starting a fierce fight. The two Qingyun Temple disciples stood guard nearby, preventing other demons from reinforcing.

Zhu Changlan didn't give the leopard-headed demon a chance to breathe, his wrist flipping, the wooden sword drawing a sharp arc, slashing towards the leopard-headed demon's neck. The leopard-headed demon quickly lowered his head to avoid, the wooden sword brushing past his head, cutting off a tuft of yellow hair. The leopard-headed demon was both shocked and angry, roaring, the black qi around his body surging, the wolf tooth club with thick evil qi, smashing towards Zhu Changlan's head.

Zhu Changlan's steps错开, his figure like a ghost avoiding the attack, while the wooden sword顺势 upward, golden demon power suddenly erupting, piercing the leopard-headed demon's shoulder. "Ouch!" The leopard-headed demon screamed, shoulder gushing dark green blood. It knew it wasn't Zhu Changlan's opponent, turning to run.

How could Zhu Changlan give it a chance? His figure flashed, blocking its way, the wooden sword with golden demon power, stabbing again, accurately piercing its heart. The leopard-headed demon's body stiffened, the light in its eyes gradually fading, crashing to the ground, completely motionless.

On the other side, the Jinyiwei dark guards had also dealt with the other leopard-headed demon. Zhu Changlan waved his hand, leading everyone into the valley.

Inside the valley, simple wooden houses were scattered, with many incomplete animal hides and skeletons drying around the houses, the demon qi and blood smell inside the valley even stronger. In the center of the valley was a huge square, paved with stones to form a huge evil array. Hundreds of demons were sitting cross-legged around the array, absorbing the evil qi emitted from the array, black qi lingering around their bodies, obviously practicing evil techniques.

Hearing the commotion at the entrance, the demons opened their eyes one after another, stopping their practice, eyes flashing with bloodthirsty light, surrounding Zhu Changlan and others. "Humans, you're so bold, daring to break in!" A tall demon came out, with a human body and lion head, covered with brown mane, holding a huge mountain-splitting axe, his eyes fierce as he stared at Zhu Changlan, obviously the leader of this stronghold.

"Remnants of the Black Bone Sect, today is your death day!" Zhu Changlan shouted coldly, carrying the wooden sword, rushing towards the lion-headed demon.

The lion-headed demon roared, waving the mountain-splitting axe, charging towards Zhu Changlan. The mountain-splitting axe with thick black qi, collided with the wooden sword, making a "dang" sound. Zhu Changlan only felt a huge force coming, his arm numb, his body retreating five steps before stabilizing, secretly shocked: This lion-headed demon's strength is stronger than the previous wild boar demon, his cultivation is at least five hundred years!

Just then, a shout of killing came from the hillside on the west side of the valley. Daoist Xuanchen took three disciples,俯冲ing down from the hillside, golden talismans like rain shooting towards the demon group, instantly many demons were hit by talismans, turning into ashes.

The demons didn't expect there was an ambush, immediately in chaos. Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, rushing towards the lion-headed demon again, the wooden sword waving densely. The golden sword light collided with the lion-headed demon's black qi, emitting a dazzling light.

The lion-headed demon was both shocked and angry, while blocking Zhu Changlan's attack, roaring to command other demons to counterattack. But now the demons were in chaos, under the joint attack of the Jinyiwei dark guards and Qingyun Temple disciples, demons kept falling, screams coming and going.

Zhu Changlan fought with the lion-headed demon. The lion-headed demon's mountain-splitting axe was infinitely powerful, every swing carrying a devastating momentum, stones around being swept by the axe wind, instantly turning into powder. Zhu Changlan relied on his flexible body, constantly avoiding attacks, while looking for the lion-headed demon's flaws. He found that although the lion-headed demon was strong, his lower body was unstable, which was his weakness.

"Roar!" The lion-headed demon, seeing his attacks repeatedly miss and being forced back by Zhu Changlan, was completely enraged. The black qi around his body surged, forming a black whirlwind,卷起 the surrounding demons into it, instantly turning them into blood water, which he absorbed into his body. His size became larger, his eyes even more疯狂, waving the mountain-splitting axe, slashing heavily towards Zhu Changlan, the axe wind carrying a strong suction, wanting to suck Zhu Changlan into the whirlwind.

Zhu Changlan's eyes condensed, circulating all his demon power, forming a solid shield around his body. He didn't avoid, but rushed towards the whirlwind, his steps kicking the ground, his body suddenly leaping, avoiding the mountain-splitting axe attack, while the wooden sword with golden demon power, stabbing towards the lion-headed demon's knee!

"Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately stabbed into the lion-headed demon's knee, dark green blood gushing out. The lion-headed demon let out a shrill scream, the pain making him lose balance, one knee kneeling on the ground, the huge mountain-splitting axe falling from his hand.

Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, his body landing behind the lion-headed demon, the wooden sword reversed, stabbing towards the lion-headed demon's back heart with golden demon power. "Ouch------" The lion-headed demon let out a final shrill scream, huge body crashing to the ground, twitching a few times and losing its breath, the black qi and whirlwind around his body gradually dissipating.

After dealing with the lion-headed demon, Zhu Changlan turned to join the battle, helping Daoist Xuanchen and the Jinyiwei dark guards clean up the remaining demons. Without their leader, the demons were even more vulnerable, and soon all the demons in the valley were cleaned up.

The battle ended, the valley was in a mess, the ground covered with demon bodies, dark green blood dyed the entire square, the air filled with blood and stench, making people nauseous. Zhu Changlan, Daoist Xuanchen and others had all consumed a lot of energy, their wounds裂开 again due to the fierce battle, oozing blood.

"Your Highness, are you okay?" Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, handing Zhu Changlan a bottle of healing medicine.

"I'm fine." Zhu Changlan took the medicine bottle, pouring out one and taking it, his gaze falling on the largest wooden house in the center of the valley, "That wooden house should be the lion-headed demon's residence. Let's go see, maybe we can find clues about the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul."

The two entered the wooden house. The interior of the wooden house was simply furnished, with only a stone bed, a stone table and several stone chairs. On the stone table, there was a black leather account book and a folded letter.

Zhu Changlan picked up the letter, unfolding it carefully. The writing on the letter was scribbled and twisted, with a strong evil qi, obviously written by a Black Bone Sect demon. The content of the letter was exactly about the whereabouts of the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul——It turned out that after the battle at Kunlun Mountain, the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul was severely injured, escaping all the way to the Ten Thousand Mountains, successively practicing and healing in the Black Wind Forest cave and Black Wind Valley stronghold. But the evil qi in these two strongholds was not enough to support his rapid recovery, so he left three to five days ago, heading to the deepest part of the Ten Thousand Mountains, the Demon Cave. The Demon Cave is the place with the thickest demon qi in the Ten Thousand Mountains,盘踞ed by countless powerful demons. The Black Bone Sect leader plans to absorb the pure demon qi of the Demon Cave there, quickly recover from his injuries, then gather Black Bone Sect remnants from all over, make a comeback, revenge on Zhu Changlan and the Crown Prince, and seize the spiritual vein source.

"Demon Cave." Zhu Changlan clenched the letter, his eyes becoming more firm, "It seems we must go to the Demon Cave, completely eliminate this remnant soul, to prevent future troubles."

Daoist Xuanchen nodded, his expression grave, "The Demon Cave is the core of the Ten Thousand Mountains, also the most dangerous place. Not only is the demon qi there thick to the extreme, but it's also盘踞ed by countless ancient demons who have practiced for thousands of years, plus the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul hiding there. Our trip there will encounter unprecedented dangers."

"No matter how dangerous it is, we must go." Zhu Changlan said firmly, "To protect the spiritual vein source, to protect my Elder Brother and the Great Ming, even if it's a sea of fire, I won't hesitate."

V. Deep into Danger: Before the Demon Cave, Undercurrents Surge

The group rested in Black Wind Valley for two days, healing their wounds, replenishing enough dry food and water, then took the letter and black token, heading towards the Demon Cave.

The Demon Cave is located in the deepest part of the Ten Thousand Mountains, hidden in the hinterland of a huge mountain range, a naturally formed huge cave. The demon qi along the way became more and more thick, almost impossible to breathe, the road more and more rugged and steep, full of sharp rocks and slippery moss, a slight carelessness could fall into an abyss. Many places on the rocks were covered with a layer of black mucus, emitting a pungent fishy smell, obviously traces left by powerful demons.

After three days of travel, the group finally arrived at the entrance of the Demon Cave. The scene before them made everyone gasp——The entrance of the Demon Cave was extremely huge, about ten zhang high and five zhang wide, like an open giant beast's mouth, swallowing all the surrounding light. The rocks around the entrance were pitch black, carved with strange runes, thick black qi lingering between the runes, forming a black barrier, emitting a palpitating pressure. At the entrance, scattered countless animal and human skeletons, piled up like mountains, some still faintly emitting black qi, obviously just吸食ed their blood by demons not long ago.

"Your Highness, this is the Demon Cave." Daoist Xuanchen's voice carried a trace of gravity, "The demon qi inside is already so thick it's tangible. One slight mistake will be eroded by evil qi and lose one's mind, becoming a madman."

Zhu Changlan gripped the wooden sword in his hand, his eyes firm, "No matter how dangerous it is, we must go in. Daoist Xuanchen, you take your disciples and the Jinyiwei dark guards, set up defenses and respond at the entrance. I'll go in first to investigate the situation. Once I find the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul, I'll crush the signal talisman, and you come in to support."

"No! Your Highness, the Demon Cave is too dangerous, it's too risky for you to go alone." Daoist Xuanchen quickly stopped him, "Why don't let me go in with you,也好有个照应."

"No need." Zhu Changlan shook his head, "The Demon Cave has a complex terrain, with crisscrossing caves, like a huge maze. Too many people will easily expose their tracks and drag each other down. My true form is a Snow Spirit Cat, good at concealing aura and exploring the environment. Going alone is more secure. You responding from the periphery is the greatest help to me."

He paused, taking out the last clay pot of fish dried from his baggage, pulling out the stopper. A strong fish dried fragrance instantly spread, in sharp contrast to the surrounding demon qi, "This is the last pot of fish dried. I'll put it at the entrance to lure the guards inside out. After the guards come out, I'll take the opportunity to enter the Demon Cave and investigate the internal situation."

Seeing his firm attitude, Daoist Xuanchen knew he couldn't stop him, so he nodded, "Your Highness must be careful. If you encounter danger, don't force yourself. Send a signal immediately, and we'll come to support at the first time."

"Good." Zhu Changlan responded, carrying the fish dried, walking to a huge rock at the entrance of the Demon Cave, pouring all the fish dried onto the rock, then quickly retreating to the rock on one side of the entrance, holding his breath, quietly observing the entrance.

The rich salty aroma of the fish dried quickly spread in the thick demon qi, like a bright lamp, attracting the demons inside. After a while, a dull "dong-dong" sound came from inside the Demon Cave, like a huge creature moving, the sound getting closer and closer, the ground trembling slightly with the footsteps.

Zhu Changlan gripped the wooden sword tightly, his eyes vigilantly staring at the entrance. He could feel an extremely powerful demon qi approaching the entrance, its strength stronger than all the demons encountered before, obviously a powerful guard of the Demon Cave.

After a while, the black qi at the entrance of the Demon Cave surged violently, a huge demon slowly walked out. This demon was covered in dark black scales, the scales glowing with a metallic luster, the size of an elephant, its head a huge lizard head, mouth open, revealing dense sharp fangs, a pair of blood-red vertical pupils staring at the fish dried on the rock, emitting a bloodthirsty light; a thick tail dragging behind it, with a sharp bone spur at the end of the tail, the bone spur glowing dark purple, obviously full of poison; four thick legs, claws sharp as knives, every step left deep claw marks on the rock.

This is a thousand-year-old scaled lizard demon! Zhu Changlan secretly exclaimed. This kind of demon has already developed considerable intelligence, with cultivation reaching a thousand-year realm, extremely powerful.

The scaled lizard demon has an extremely sensitive sense of smell. As soon as it walked out of the Demon Cave, it was attracted by the fish dried fragrance on the rock. Its blood-red vertical pupils locked onto the rock direction, dragging its heavy body slowly walking over. Its movements seemed slow, but carried a suffocating sense of pressure, the air around it seemed to freeze.

Zhu Changlan held his breath, his gaze fixed on the scaled lizard demon's movements. This lizard demon's scales were extremely hard, ordinary attacks根本无法穿透, only its eyes, abdomen and throat were weak points. He planned to wait for the lizard demon to approach the fish dried, lower its head to eat, and then launch a surprise attack, first blinding its eyes, then subduing it, forcing it to reveal the exact location of the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul.

Just as the scaled lizard demon lowered its head, sticking out its tongue to roll the fish dried, Zhu Changlan moved! His figure was like a golden lightning bolt, suddenly darting out from behind the rock, his demon power surging all over his body, the wooden sword fully wrapped in golden demon power, with a sharp sound of breaking air, straight stabbing the scaled lizard demon's left eye!

The scaled lizard demon obviously didn't expect an ambush, its blood-red vertical pupils suddenly contracting, instinctively raising its front claw to block the wooden sword. "Dang!" A deafening collision sound, sparks flying. The wooden sword hit the lizard demon's claw hard, but was rebounded back. Zhu Changlan only felt his arm剧痛, his body being shaken back seven or eight steps before stabilizing, his tiger mouth even split open

, blood dripping from his fingertips. The black qi at the entrance of the Demon Cave was stirred by the violent collision, mixing with the dust raised by broken stones, forming a chaotic gray mist in the dim light. This scaled lizard demon's defense is so strong! Zhu Changlan was secretly shocked, but didn't dare to hesitate for a moment. The scaled lizard demon was completely enraged, its blood-red vertical pupils死死锁定 him, letting out a deafening roar, the thick tail with a whooshing wind, like a steel whip, slashing heavily towards him. This tail has a thousand jin of force, carrying the cold demon qi from deep in the cave. If hit, it would break bones and tendons. Zhu Changlan's eyes condensed, demon power bursting from his feet, his figure floating to the side like a willow catkin, narrowly avoiding the tail attack. "Boom!" The tail hit the rock where he was standing just now, the huge rock instantly shattered into powder, broken stones mixed with bone debris splashing everywhere, hitting the surrounding black stone walls with a crackling sound. He used the momentum of floating, quickly pulling away from the lizard demon, but his back accidentally hit a rock wall carved with strange runes. The cold touch spread along his spine, making him more awake. The palm holding the wooden sword was sweating, his brain rapidly thinking about a way to break through.

This lizard demon not only has amazing defense, but also has霸道 unmatched strength. Hard fighting is definitely not a victory. Zhu Changlan's gaze quickly swept over the lizard demon's body, falling on the area of its abdomen where the color was lighter and the scales were more sparse——that was its weak point, but it was blocked by its thick limbs, extremely difficult to hit. He took a deep breath, forcing down the pain in his arm, golden demon power flowing around his body again, colliding with the thick black demon qi around him, producing细碎 light屑. This time he didn't rush to attack, but stepped lightly, leaving several golden afterimages in place, quickly walking around the lizard demon. The ground under his feet was full of sharp rocks and slippery moss, as well as many bone remains. Every step needed to be careful. The scaled lizard demon was enraged by his actions, roaring as it turned its head, its blood-red vertical pupils shining with fierce light in the dim environment. Its thick tail kept sweeping around it, sweeping over rocks and bone remains,掀起 bursts of fishy air, trying to force him to stop.

But Zhu Changlan's figure was like a ghost, always avoiding attacks at the last moment, and gradually closing the distance to the lizard demon's abdomen. The scaled lizard demon, seeing it couldn't touch Zhu Changlan, became even more疯狂. It suddenly stopped turning, its huge body suddenly charging, carrying fishy demon wind, its mouth full of fangs, biting heavily towards Zhu Changlan's walking trajectory!

Zhu Changlan's eyes suddenly changed, his feet stepping on the bone remains to borrow strength, his body leaping into the air, but his clothes were still scraped by the bone spurs on its back, tearing a long mouth, cold wind mixed with demon qi instantly pouring in. Before he could stabilize his body, the lizard demon's tail had swept towards him like a shadow, the tail tip's poison spur glowing with dark purple light, stabbing straight at his waist and abdomen.

Zhu Changlan secretly cursed, quickly drawing his sword to block, but the tail's strength was too great, he was knocked flying, heavily hitting the rock wall carved with strange runes behind him. His throat was sweet, spitting out a mouthful of blood, staining the broken stones in front of him.

The warm blood choked Zhu Changlan's throat, the pain of hitting the rock wall made his eyes darken, and the hand holding the wooden sword couldn't help but shake slightly. He forced himself to half kneel on the ground, the demon power shield having been broken in the impact, the surrounding thick black qi taking the opportunity to crazily pour in, drilling into his meridians through his pores, bringing burning stings. The scaled lizard demon, seeing him injured, a cruel smile flashed in its red vertical pupils, its huge body slowly approaching, every step making the ground tremble, broken stones and bone remains being crushed into powder under its feet, thick demon qi surging like a tide, enveloping Zhu Changlan.

It didn't rush to attack, but dragged its thick tail to pace around Zhu Changlan, the tail tip's poison spur occasionally sliding across the ground, leaving deep scratches, obviously wanting to toy with its prey before giving a fatal blow. Zhu Changlan lowered his head, breathing heavily, using this gap to quickly circulate the remaining demon power, repairing the damaged meridians, while his fingertips quietly touched the calming talisman in his arms——this was his only chance now.

When his fingertips touched the cold talisman paper, Zhu Changlan's heart was slightly settled. This talisman paper was filled with faint Taoist clear qi, which was the key to dispelling evil qi and disturbing the demon's mind. The scaled lizard demon, seeing him always lowering his head, seemingly unable to resist, finally lost patience with toying. Its huge body suddenly charged, carrying fishy demon wind, opening its mouth full of fangs, biting heavily towards Zhu Changlan's head!

At this critical moment, Zhu Changlan suddenly raised his head, golden light bursting in his eyes, the calming talisman夹在 his fingertips suddenly thrown out, while he shouted lowly: "Break!"

The calming talisman turned into a dazzling golden light in the air, accurately hitting the lizard demon's head, "Boom" exploding, golden clear light instantly spreading, dispelling most of the black qi around the lizard demon. The lizard demon let out a painful hiss, its movements suddenly slowing, confusion in its red vertical pupils, obviously its spiritual consciousness was impacted.

Zhu Changlan seized this fleeting opportunity, forced himself to stand up, all the remaining demon power in his body poured into the wooden sword, his figure like an arrow leaving the string, stabbing towards the weak spot of the lizard demon's abdomen again!

This time, he didn't hold back at all, fully displaying the agility and explosive power of his Snow Spirit Cat true form. His figure passed over the ground, the airflow卷起细碎 bone remains and dust. The golden demon power at the front of the wooden sword was extremely condensed, even faintly making a humming sound, accurately aiming at the gap between the scales on the lizard demon's abdomen in the gap before the clear light dissipated.

"Puchi------" This time, the wooden sword was not stuck, but with unstoppable force, fiercely piercing into the lizard demon's body!

The intense pain made the lizard demon wake up from the confusion of its spiritual consciousness, letting out a heart-piercing scream, its huge body violently twisting, its four limbs randomly kicking, the surrounding rocks being hit with a loud crash, black qi surging out from its body.

Zhu Changlan tightly held the wooden sword, letting the lizard demon's struggle drive his body to shake, while continuously pouring the remaining demon power into the lizard demon's body along the sword, crazily destroying its demon core and meridians. Dark green blood continuously gushed out along the texture of the wooden sword, splashing all over Zhu Changlan's clothes. The pungent stench almost made him choke. I don't know how long it took, the lizard demon's struggle gradually weakened, its red vertical pupils lost all luster, its huge body crashing to the ground, twitching a few times and losing its breath, the black qi around its body gradually dissipating.

Zhu Changlan couldn't support it any longer, letting go of the wooden sword, staggering back a few steps, sitting heavily on the ground, panting violently, all his strength seemingly drained.
