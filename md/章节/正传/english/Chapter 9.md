## Chapter 9: Fish Jerky as Bait, Initial Clues Uncovered

The 25th year of the Wanli era in the Ming Dynasty, early summer.

The morning light of Xian'an Palace, wrapped in the fresh fragrance of newly sprouted osmanthus leaves, filtered through the layered branches, weaving intricate patterns of light on the bluestone floor like scattered diamonds. Zhu Changlan sat by the stone table in the courtyard, pinching a piece of golden, translucent fish jerky between his fingers. A rich, salty aroma lingered at the tip of his nose—this was specially made by Little Luzi at his request. It used the fattest silver fish from the imperial river, scaled and gutted, then thoroughly rubbed with coarse salt, marinated for three full hours to remove the fishy smell, and then dried in a ventilated bamboo sieve for three days. During this time, it had to be flipped repeatedly until the fish flesh contracted tightly, exuding a faint layer of salt frost, and when bitten, carried the unique sweetness of river freshness.

"My Lord, try this batch! I guarantee it's more to your taste than last time!" Little Luzi hurried over carrying a carved wooden plate, on which neatly arranged fish jerky glowed with an enticing luster. His face wore a simple, honest smile. "I specially went to the Eastern Palace imperial kitchen to learn a trick. I added half a spoonful of nectar to balance the saltiness during marination, and covered it with a thin layer of gauze to keep out dust when drying. It retains the fish fragrance without any impurities."

Zhu Changlan picked up a piece and put it in his mouth. The moment his teeth bit down, the firmness and chewiness of the fish flesh instantly spread. The salty aroma filled his tongue, with a subtle sweetness lingering at the end, growing more flavorful the more he chewed. He nodded slowly, a hint of satisfaction flashing in his eyes: "It has indeed improved, more mellow than last time."

Little Luzi, pleased with the praise, straightened his back a little: "Of course! If you like it, I'll keep experimenting to make it even better."

Zhu Changlan smiled, his fingertips caressing the texture of the fish jerky, but his gaze drifted to the courtyard gate, a hint of gravity hidden in his eyes. Since receiving news from Qingyun Temple that the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul had fled to the Hundred Thousand Mountains in the Southern Border, he hadn't dared to slacken for a single day. The Crown Prince initially refused to let him go in person, fearing his newly recovered body couldn't withstand the hardships, and even more afraid of the unpredictable dangers in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. But he couldn't resist Zhu Changlan's repeated pleadings, and finally relented, not only sending 20 elite Jin Yiwei Dark Division members to accompany him, but also inviting Daoist Xuanchen from Qingyun Temple with five disciples, saying it would provide more protection.

As departure approached, what worried him most was how to find that cunning residual soul in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The place was mountainous and densely forested, with lingering demonic energy. Ordinary detection methods were completely useless, and moreover, the Black Bone Cult Leader had always been skilled at concealing his aura, fleeing at the slightest movement. Just as he was frowning in worry, he suddenly remembered his true form as a Snow Spirit Cat—Snow Spirit Cats are naturally sensitive to the smell of fish, and the demonic creatures of the Black Bone Cult, who constantly feast on the blood of living beings, inevitably carry an indelible smell of blood. These two scents mixed together might form a unique "lure" to attract those demonic creatures to reveal themselves. That's why he asked Little Luzi to rush and make a large batch of fish jerky, planning to use it as bait to lure the enemy.

"Little Luzi, pack all this fish jerky into clay pots, each lined with oiled paper to keep out moisture." Zhu Changlan收回目光, commanding in a deep voice, "Also prepare a few pieces of clean oiled cloth, they'll come in handy on the road."

"Yes, right away!" Little Luzi quickly responded, turning around with the wooden plate to get busy.

Zhu Changlan stood up and walked to the center of the courtyard, lifting the dark wood sword. The sword body glowed with a warm black sheen in the morning light, cool but not icy to the touch. It was specially polished by the Crown Prince according to his hand shape. He twisted his wrist lightly, the wood sword cutting through the air, creating a sharp whistle. Faint golden demonic power flowed along the sword body, condensing into a point of light at the tip. After several days of hard training, his demonic power had recovered more than seventy percent, his meridians had become more unobstructed due to the nourishment of spirit herbs, and his moves had become more fluid, no longer as awkward as before. He had confidence that even if he encountered remnants of the Black Bone Cult, he could handle them freely.

## I. Departure for the Southern Border: A Long Road Ahead, Hidden Dangers Lurk

Three days later, just as dawn was breaking, Zhu Changlan and his party set off for the Southern Border.

The Crown Prince personally came to the palace gate to see them off, his light yellow regular clothes making his eyebrows and eyes even more gentle, but his gaze towards Zhu Changlan hid worry and reluctance. "Ninth Brother, this journey to the Southern Border is long. Put your own safety first, and never be reckless." He stepped forward, personally adjusting the reins on Zhu Changlan's saddle. "If you encounter danger, don't force yourself. Send someone back to the capital immediately, and I'll dispatch Southern Border garrisons to support you right away."

Zhu Changlan mounted his horse, reined in the reins, and bowed deeply, his voice steady: "Don't worry, Brother Emperor. I know my limits. As for matters in the capital, I'll trouble you to take care of them. Although the remnants of Concubine Zheng and the Third Prince have been eliminated, the undercurrents in the court are still not calm. You must be more careful."

"I understand." The Crown Prince nodded, taking out a sandalwood brocade box from his sleeve and handing it to Zhu Changlan. "Inside is the military talisman bestowed by Father. With this, you can mobilize the garrisons of all states in the Southern Border. Take it with you; it might come in handy at a critical moment."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade box with both hands, feeling its weight, and carefully tucked it into his inner pocket: "Thank you, Brother Emperor."

"And this." The Crown Prince handed over a small pear wood medicine chest. "Inside are golden sore medicine and detoxification pills specially made by the Imperial Hospital, as well as Clear Heart Talismans personally drawn by Daoist Xuanqing. They can dispel evil qi and stabilize spiritual consciousness. Keep them close and never lose them."

Zhu Changlan took the medicine chest, the warmth of the box touching his fingertips, a surge of warmth in his heart: "Brother Emperor, you must also take care of yourself. After I eliminate the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul, I will return to the capital as soon as possible."

The Crown Prince waved his hand, expectation in his eyes: "Go, have a safe journey."

Zhu Changlan turned his horse around, his gaze sweeping over the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members and Qingyun Temple disciples behind him, and said in a deep voice: "Depart!"

The sound of hooves broke through the morning mist as the group galloped along the official road towards the Southern Border. Daoist Xuanchen rode a black horse, riding alongside Zhu Changlan. He wore a cyan Taoist robe, a peach wood sword hanging at his waist, his expression solemn: "Ninth Prince, the Hundred Thousand Mountains have long been known as the 'Demonic Lair'. Not only is the demonic energy there dense, but there are also countless uncivilized fierce beasts and demonic creatures that have cultivated into spirits, not to mention the remnants of the Black Bone Cult lying in wait. This journey is extremely dangerous."

"I know." Zhu Changlan looked ahead, his voice calm but with unwavering determination. "But as long as the Black Bone Cult exists, the mortal world will never have peace, and Brother Emperor and the Source of Spiritual Veins will always be in danger. Even if the road ahead is a mountain of knives and a sea of fire, I must go." He turned his head to look at Daoist Xuanchen, nodding slightly: "This trip to the Southern Border will require much trouble from you and the other senior brothers."

"You're too kind, Prince." Daoist Xuanchen cupped his hands. "Guarding the righteous path of the mortal world is the duty of Qingyun Temple. It is my honor to eradicate demons with you, Prince."

The group continued south, and the climate became increasingly hot and humid as they approached the Southern Border. The trees along the official road gradually changed to tall banyan and camphor trees, their lush branches and leaves blocking out the sky, with sunlight only able to pass through the gaps to cast scattered points of light on the moss-covered road. The air was filled with a thick smell of vegetation and moisture, making it feel sticky when inhaled into the lungs. Many Jin Yiwei Dark Division members frowned slightly.

After traveling for five days, the group officially entered the Southern Border. The terrain here was no longer as flat as the Central Plains, with undulating hills and winding mountain roads everywhere. The official road became rough and narrow, making it extremely difficult for horses to walk. The villages along the way were sparse and scattered, occasionally seeing a few villagers wearing indigo homespun cloth and bamboo hats. They looked at the group with vigilant eyes, and when they saw Zhu Changlan and others in their distinguished attire, they hurried away, showing a distant air of not wanting to approach strangers.

"My Lord, there's a Black Wind Forest about three miles ahead, filled with miasma. Why don't we rest here for a while, let the horses catch their breath, and let the brothers drink some water to dispel the summer heat." The leader of the Jin Yiwei Dark Division reined in his horse and reported in a low voice. He had been executing missions outside for years and had some understanding of the terrain in the Southern Border.

Zhu Changlan reined in his horse, looking ahead. Not far away, the forest was pitch black, with faint gray-black miasma winding among the treetops, vaguely exuding an ominous evil aura. He nodded: "Good, let's rest here. Daoist Xuanchen, please take two senior brothers to investigate the situation in the Black Wind Forest, paying attention to whether there is demonic energy and ambushes."

"As you command." Daoist Xuanchen replied, then called two disciples, dismounted, and walked quickly towards the Black Wind Forest with light steps. They moved swiftly, soon disappearing at the edge of the dense forest.

Zhu Changlan and the others dismounted one after another, tying their horses to old banyan trees by the roadside. Little Luzi quickly took out water bags and pastries from the luggage, distributing them to everyone: "My Lord, try this mung bean cake. It was specially made by the Eastern Palace kitchen, with mint added to clear heat and relieve summer heat."

Zhu Changlan took a mung bean cake and took a bite. The cold, sweet taste instantly dispelled some of the summer heat. He looked at the Black Wind Forest not far away, his eyes full of vigilance. The miasma in that forest mixed with a faint demonic energy, definitely not ordinary miasma. It was likely that there were demonic creatures盘踞 within, possibly a hiding place for remnants of the Black Bone Cult.

After about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, Daoist Xuanchen returned with his disciples, his face even more grave than before: "My Lord, the demonic energy in the Black Wind Forest is dense, and there are obvious traces of Black Bone Cult demonic creatures' activities. We found a hidden cave deep in the forest, its entrance covered by vines. The vines are wrapped in dense evil qi, and there are faint sounds of demonic creatures moving inside. There must be many demonic creatures gathered inside."

Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened as he stood up, gripping his wooden sword tightly: "It seems we've found the right place. Daoist Xuanchen, you take your disciples and the Jin Yiwei Dark Division to set up defenses outside as backup. I'll go investigate the cave."

"No!" Daoist Xuanchen quickly劝阻, "The situation inside the cave is unknown, and the demonic energy is heavy. It's too dangerous for you to go alone. Let me go with you, so we can look out for each other."

"No need." Zhu Changlan shook his head, his tone firm, "The cave is narrow, and two people going together would be inconvenient to move. I have my own way to protect myself. You stay outside as backup. If you hear any movement inside, come in to support immediately." He paused, taking out a clay pot from his luggage, pulling out the stopper. The rich fragrance of fish jerky instantly filled the air. "This fish jerky is the bait I prepared. I'll put it at the cave entrance to lure the demonic creatures inside out, then take the opportunity to investigate the situation inside the cave."

Daoist Xuanchen saw that he was resolute and knew he couldn't be persuaded, so he nodded: "My Lord, please be careful. If you encounter danger, crush this signal talisman immediately." With that, he handed over a yellow talisman.

Zhu Changlan took the talisman and put it away: "Thank you, Daoist." With that, he提着 the clay pot and walked lightly towards the depths of the Black Wind Forest.

## II. Fish Jerky as Bait: Demonic Creatures Appear, Initial Clues Uncovered

In the depths of the Black Wind Forest, the light became increasingly dim, with tall trees intertwined and only scattered spots of light leaking through the leaves. The demonic energy in the air grew thicker and thicker, mixed with the stench of rotting flesh and the bitterness of miasma, making one's throat tight. Zhu Changlan circulated his demonic power, forming a thin shield around his body to block some of the evil qi, while concealing his own aura, his steps as light as a cat's, silently moving towards the cave direction.

The cave was hidden in a recess in the mountainside, its entrance tightly covered by dense blood-red vines. The edges of the vine leaves were sharp thorns, with some dry animal fur hanging from them, clearly traces left by passing creatures that were entangled and torn. Around the cave entrance were scattered many残缺的 animal bones, covered with a faint layer of black qi. When a finger was brought close, one could feel a piercing chill—this was the residual evil qi after being sucked dry of blood by demonic creatures.

Zhu Changlan circled to the back of an ancient banyan tree beside the cave, using the tree trunk for cover as he carefully observed the cave entrance. After confirming there were no other ambushes, he提着 the clay pot, walked lightly to a rock not far from the cave entrance, poured most of the fish jerky onto the rock, then quickly retreated to the back of the banyan tree, holding his breath and staring intently at the cave entrance.

The rich, salty aroma of the fish jerky quickly spread in the hot, humid air, mingling with the surrounding demonic energy and stench of decay, forming a strange but extremely alluring scent. Before long, a rustling sound came from inside the cave, like countless tiny claws scratching the stone wall, growing clearer from far to near.

Zhu Changlan gripped his wooden sword tightly, his fingertips slightly turning white with force. He could feel a strong demonic aura approaching the cave entrance, turbid and violent, clearly a ferocious demonic creature.

After a moment, the blood-red vines at the cave entrance suddenly shook violently, and a thick vine was forcibly pushed open from the middle. A demonic creature comparable in size to a water buffalo slowly crawled out. Its entire body was covered in dark brown hard shells, covered with spiral protrusions, like embedded countless small bone spurs. Its head was triangular, with a pair of eerie green compound eyes, and the dense compound eye crystals shone coldly in the dim light. Two curved venomous pincers extended from both sides of its mouth, the tips of which glowed dark purple, clearly dipped in deadly poison. Eight thick, spiked legs carried its heavy body slowly forward, every step crunching the weeds beneath its hard shell into powder.

This is a venomous pincer centipede that has cultivated into a spirit! Zhu Changlan understood. This kind of demonic creature is cruel by nature, fond of feeding on the blood of living beings, and is one of the most commonly recruited minions of the Black Bone Cult.

The venomous pincer centipede has an extremely sensitive sense of smell. As soon as it crawled out of the cave, it was attracted by the fish jerky aroma on the rock. Its green compound eyes locked onto the rock direction, dragging its heavy body slowly towards it. Its movements seemed slow, but carried a suffocating sense of oppression, with the weeds along the way crushed into powder by its hard shell.

Zhu Changlan held his breath, his gaze fixed on the venomous pincer centipede's movements. This centipede demon's cultivation is not low, with a hard shell that is extremely tough, ordinary swords恐怕难以穿透, only its eyes and abdomen are weak points. He planned to wait for the centipede demon to approach the fish jerky, relaxing its vigilance, then launch a surprise attack, first blinding its eyes, then subduing it while it's disoriented, forcing it to reveal the whereabouts of the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul.

Just as the venomous pincer centipede's venomous pincers were about to touch the fish jerky, Zhu Changlan moved! His figure was like a golden flash of lightning, suddenly darting out from behind the banyan tree. His周身 demonic power surged, the wooden sword wrapped in golden demonic power, cutting through the air with a sharp whistle, stabbing straight at the centipede's compound eyes!

The venomous pincer centipede clearly didn't expect an ambush, its green compound eyes suddenly contracting. It subconsciously waved its front pincers, blocking towards the wooden sword. "Dang!" A piercing metallic collision sound rang out, sparks flying. The wooden sword hit the pincers hard, bouncing back slightly, while only a shallow white mark was left on the centipede's pincers.

"Sss------" The venomous pincer centipede was enraged, emitting a shrill hiss. The black qi around its body suddenly surged, and its eight spiked legs suddenly kicked the ground. Its huge body crashed fiercely towards Zhu Changlan, its pincers waving with thick poison gas, clamping towards Zhu Changlan's head.

Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, his steps retreating rapidly. At the same time, he flipped his wrist, the wooden sword drawing an arc, blocking the pincer attack. The poison gas rushed towards him, blocked by his demonic power shield, not harming him. He used the force of his retreat to suddenly side-step, avoiding the centipede's charge, while the wooden sword顺势 downward, wrapped in golden demonic power, stabbing towards the centipede's soft abdomen!

"Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately pierced the venomous pincer centipede's abdomen, dark green blood instantly gushing out, carrying a pungent stench. The centipede emitted a shrill scream, its huge body twitching violently. Black qi swirled from the wound, clearly its demonic power rapidly dissipating.

Zhu Changlan showed no mercy, gripping the wooden sword tightly and channeling more golden demonic power into it, which surged into the centipede's body, frantically destroying its meridians and demon core. The centipede's twitching grew weaker and weaker, its green compound eyes gradually losing their luster, and finally its huge body crashed to the ground, no longer moving.

Zhu Changlan pulled out his wooden sword, shaking off the dark green blood on it, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. This centipede demon's cultivation was not low, with a hard shell that was extremely tough. It was just a low-level minion of the Black Bone Cult, so there must be stronger demonic creatures inside the cave. He didn't rush into the cave, but turned back to the forest edge, informing Daoist Xuanchen and the Jin Yiwei Dark Division about the situation inside the cave.

"My Lord, it seems this cave in the Black Wind Forest is indeed a stronghold of the Black Bone Cult." Daoist Xuanchen said with a grave face after hearing, "This kind of venomous pincer centipede takes at least a hundred years to cultivate to this level. To be able to command such demonic creatures, the leader of the demonic creatures inside must be no simple character."

"Hmm." Zhu Changlan nodded, "This is just a small minion; the real core members are still inside the cave. It's too risky to force our way in. We might as well continue using fish jerky as bait to lure the demonic creatures inside out of the cave, then take the opportunity to wipe them out, and then enter the cave to investigate."

"My Lord's method is excellent." Daoist Xuanchen agreed, "These demonic creatures are greedy by nature; the fish jerky aroma will definitely lure them all out. We can set up ambushes around the cave entrance. Once the demonic creatures come out, we'll annihilate them in one fell swoop."

"Good." Zhu Changlan replied, then took out the remaining fish jerky from his luggage, distributing it to the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members and Qingyun Temple disciples, "You scatter the fish jerky on rocks and branches around the cave entrance, then hide in the dark to ambush. The senior brothers from Qingyun Temple prepare talismans, and the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members guard all exits. Once the demonic creatures come out, act immediately."

Everyone took their orders, carrying fish jerky and moving silently towards the cave direction. They moved quickly, soon finishing arranging the fish jerky, then hid behind the surrounding trees and rocks, gripping their weapons and remaining vigilant.

Zhu Changlan hid behind the original banyan tree, his wooden sword held horizontally in front of him, his eyes focused on the cave entrance. He could clearly feel the demonic energy inside the cave growing more and more restless, obviously the demonic creatures inside were all attracted by the fish jerky aroma, gathering towards the cave entrance.

After about half an incense stick's time, a dense rustling sound came from inside the cave, louder than when the venomous pincer centipede came out. The blood-red vines at the cave entrance shook violently, and then one demonic creature after another crawled out of the cave—some were winged blood-sucking bat demons, with wingspans of over two meters, sharp fangs exposed; some were wolf demons covered in black fur, their eyes glowing with bloodthirsty red light; others were sturdy toad demons, their skin covered with poison sacs, crawling step by step, leaving pools of smoking venom.

"Attack!" Zhu Changlan shouted in a low voice, rushing out first. The wooden sword, wrapped in golden demonic power, like a streamer, stabbed straight at the head of a wolf demon at the front.

Daoist Xuanchen and his disciples attacked at the same time, several golden talismans flying from their hands, turning into golden rays of light in the air, shooting towards the demonic creatures. "Boom! Boom!" The talismans landed in the middle of the demonic creature group, exploding into golden flames. Many smaller bat demons were instantly burned to ashes.

The Jin Yiwei Dark Division members also rushed out one after another, their steel swords glowing coldly, engaging with the demonic creatures. For a moment, the Black Wind Forest was filled with the sounds of battle—demonic creatures' roars, the clash of swords, the explosion of talismans—all intertwined, echoing through the sky.

Zhu Changlan's figure moved nimbly through the group of demonic creatures, his wooden sword挥舞得密不透风. These demonic creatures were fierce, and Zhu Changlan showed no mercy, each sword aimed at the vital points of the demonic creatures. The golden demonic power flowed along the sword body, and when it touched the demonic creatures' bodies, it would burn black holes, making the demonic creatures roar in pain. A bat demon dove down from the air, biting towards his neck. Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold, his wrist flipping suddenly, the wooden sword挑向上, accurately piercing the bat demon's wing, then kicking it away, sending it crashing into a tree trunk, twitching a few times before dying.

Daoist Xuanchen held a peach wood sword, chanting incantations under his breath. The peach wood sword glowed with a faint golden light, and every swing could split a mass of demonic energy. His disciples formed a sword formation, their talismans and sword light配合, slaying one demonic creature after another. The Jin Yiwei Dark Division members cooperated tacitly, working in groups of three, their attacks and defenses orderly, and demonic creatures fell with every rise and fall of their steel swords.

The battle lasted for nearly an hour, until the sun slanted west, before all the demonic creatures at the cave entrance were completely eliminated. The ground was covered with the bodies of demonic creatures, their dark green and black blood staining the ground, and the air was filled with a thick smell of blood and decay, nauseating.

Zhu Changlan leaned on his wooden sword, breathing heavily, sweat dripping from his forehead, soaking his front. His body was covered with demonic creature blood, and his clothes were torn in several places by demonic creature claws, revealing faint scars underneath, but his eyes were still firm. After this battle, his demonic power was consumed a lot, but it circulated more condensed than before, and his state of mind became more stable.

"My Lord, are you all right?" Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, handing Zhu Changlan a bottle of healing pills, concerned.

"I'm fine." Zhu Changlan took the pills, poured out one and swallowed it, shaking his head, "These are just peripheral members of the Black Bone Cult; the real core is still inside the cave. Let's rest for half an hour to replenish our strength, then enter the cave to investigate."

## III. Exploring the Cave: Black Qi Fills, Hidden Secrets

Everyone rested briefly outside the forest for half an hour, drinking some water and eating some dry food to replenish their strength. After taking the pills, Zhu Changlan's minor injuries had basically healed, and his demonic power had recovered about thirty to forty percent.

After resting, the group walked towards the cave. At this time, the vines at the cave entrance had been shattered by the aftermath of the battle, revealing a dark cave mouth, like a巨口 waiting to devour someone. Thick black qi filled the cave, mixed with blood and decay, several times stronger than outside. Just approaching the cave entrance, one could feel difficulty breathing.

"Be careful, the black qi inside the cave is thick, there may be evil traps. Follow my steps and don't touch anything inside the cave." Zhu Changlan warned, then circulated his demonic power, his cat's eye stone glowing with a faint blue light, illuminating the road ahead. He was the first to enter the cave, followed by Daoist Xuanchen and the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members.

The interior of the cave was more complex than imagined. The entrance was narrow, only allowing one person to pass through. After walking for about a dozen steps, the cave suddenly became spacious, forming a winding passage. The cave walls were covered with damp dark green moss, which would leave a layer of sticky juice when touched, emitting a faint fishy smell. On the stone walls on both sides of the passage, there were occasional grooves carved with strange patterns, with residual black qi lingering in the grooves, clearly traces left by demonic creatures practicing evil arts before.

The deeper they went into the cave, the thicker the black qi became, and the sense of oppression grew stronger. Zhu Changlan could feel the surrounding evil qi constantly eroding his demonic power shield. If it weren't for the Clear Heart Talisman protecting his spiritual consciousness, he would have already been affected by the evil qi, becoming manic and restless.

After walking for nearly an hour, the passage ahead suddenly opened up, forming a huge stone chamber. The stone chamber was about three zhang high, with many stalactites hanging from the ceiling, dripping water droplets, and the "tick-tock, tick-tock" sound was格外清晰 in the silent stone chamber. In the center of the stone chamber stood a half-human-high black altar, made of unknown black stone, its surface covered with twisted runes, around which was dense black qi. On the altar were three skull artifacts, with flickering green flames in their eye sockets, emitting a terrifying evil aura.

Around the altar were scattered many human bones,残缺不全, obviously cruelly tortured and sucked dry of blood by demonic creatures. In the four corners of the stone chamber, there was a huge demonic creature蜷缩 in each corner, their bodies covered with thick black qi, like four black clouds. When they heard the movement, they slowly raised their heads, revealing their ferocious faces.

"It's you damned humans again, daring to break in and ruin the教主's great plan!" The demonic creature in the left corner slowly stood up, comparable in size to a yellow ox, its body covered with gray mane, its head a huge wild boar's head, two curved fangs glowing coldly, its eyes fierce as it stared at Zhu Changlan and the others, its voice hoarse like a broken gong, shaking the stone chamber slightly.

Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold: "Is your教主 the leader of the Black Bone Cult? Where is he now?"

"Hmph, how would we tell you lowly humans the whereabouts of our教主!" The wild boar demon roared, suddenly charging towards Zhu Changlan, its huge hooves stomping on the ground, making a "thud-thud" sound. The black qi around its body condensed into a huge bone knife, slashing towards Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan didn't dare to be careless, gripping his wooden sword tightly, channeling his demonic power. Golden demonic power flowed along the sword body, meeting the bone knife head-on. "Dang!" A loud crash, golden demonic power and black evil qi clashed, forming a powerful wave of air that spread around. Zhu Changlan only felt his arm go numb, his body being pushed back three steps by the wave of air before steadying himself, secretly shocked: This wild boar demon's strength is so formidable, its cultivation is more than a notch higher than the previous venomous pincer centipede, clearly a core member of the Black Bone Cult.

At the same time, the other three demonic creatures also stood up and attacked. A fox demon with a snake tail swung its claws, pouncing on the Qingyun Temple disciples; a huge stone-armored monster, its body covered with hard rocks, charged towards the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members; and a crow demon with wings circled in the air, occasionally letting out ear-piercing screams, trying to disrupt everyone's minds.

Seeing this, Daoist Xuanchen quickly shouted: "Disciples, form a formation to defend against enemies! Leader of the Jin Yiwei Dark Division, take people to entangle the stone-armored monster!" With that, he held the peach wood sword, charging towards the fox demon, the golden light on the peach wood sword surging, blocking the fox demon's attack.

The stone chamber was immediately陷入 a chaotic battle. Zhu Changlan was entangled with the wild boar demon. The wild boar demon was extremely powerful, and every slash of its bone knife carried a destructive momentum. Zhu Changlan could only rely on his nimble body to constantly dodge, looking for opportunities to counterattack. He found that although the wild boar demon was strong, its movements were slightly slow, and its eyes were easily enraged. As long as it was enraged, it would reveal flaws.

"You coward who only knows how to hide!" The wild boar demon, seeing its attacks repeatedly miss, roared, the black qi around its body surging, the bone knife becoming even larger. "Today I'll tear you to pieces and sacrifice you to my cult's artifacts!"

It suddenly charged forward, the bone knife slashing fiercely towards Zhu Changlan's head. Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, no longer dodging. Instead, he channeled all his demonic power, the wooden sword completely wrapped in golden demonic power. He kicked off the ground, his body leaping upward, avoiding the bone knife while the wooden sword, with sharp锋芒, stabbed towards the wild boar demon's left eye!

The wild boar demon didn't expect Zhu Changlan to suddenly counterattack, its pupils contracting sharply. It tried to turn its head to avoid, but it was too late. "Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately pierced the wild boar demon's left eye, dark green blood gushing out. The wild boar demon let out a heart-wrenching scream, the intense pain making it completely lose its mind, madly waving its bone knife, slashing randomly around.

Using the force of his leap, Zhu Changlan flipped in the air and landed steadily. He didn't give the wild boar demon a chance to catch its breath, his steps shifting, charging forward again. The wooden sword avoided the madly waving bone knife, stabbing towards the wild boar demon's neck. At this point, the wild boar demon was completely out of control, unable to distinguish directions. The wooden sword pierced its neck without hindrance, and golden demonic power instantly surged in, frantically destroying its demon core.

"Oww------" The wild boar demon let out its final凄厉 scream, its huge body crashing to the ground, twitching a few times before dying, the black qi around its body gradually dissipating.

After dealing with the wild boar demon, Zhu Changlan turned to look at the other battlefields. Daoist Xuanchen had already killed the fox demon and was leading his disciples to assist the Jin Yiwei Dark Division in besieging the stone-armored monster; the crow demon in the air was entangled by two Jin Yiwei Dark Division members, gradually falling into a disadvantage. Zhu Changlan提着 his wooden sword, charging towards the crow demon. With a wave of the wooden sword, golden demonic power turned into a sword qi, slashing towards the crow demon's wing.

The crow demon screamed as its wing was cut, bleeding profusely, no longer able to maintain flight, falling from the air. The Jin Yiwei Dark Division members took the opportunity to step forward, their steel swords stabbing down together, killing the crow demon.

Only the stone-armored monster remained, under the joint attack of Daoist Xuanchen and the Jin Yiwei Dark Division, the rock armor on its body was already covered with cracks, its aura growing weaker. Zhu Changlan stepped forward, the wooden sword wrapped in golden demonic power, stabbing towards the stone-armored monster's head. "Puchi" sound, the wooden sword pierced through the rock armor, stabbing into the stone-armored monster's head. The stone-armored monster let out a沉闷 roar, its huge body crashing to the ground, completely dead.

The battle ended, and the stone chamber was in a mess. The ground was covered with the bodies of demonic creatures, their dark green blood mixing with human bones, a horrifying sight. Zhu Changlan, Daoist Xuanchen, and the others had all consumed a lot of energy, and more or less had some injuries.

"My Lord, are you all right?" Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, concerned.

"It's fine." Zhu Changlan shook his head, his gaze falling on the central black altar, "Let's check what clues are on the altar."

The two walked to the altar, carefully observing the runes and artifacts on the altar. Daoist Xuanchen frowned, carefully identifying the runes: "These runes are the Black Bone Cult's 'Gathering Yin and Devouring Soul Array', more insidious than the previous Gathering Yin Array. Not only can it absorb the surrounding yin qi, but it can also devour the souls of living beings, converting them into evil qi for cultivators to absorb. It seems the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul did practice here before."

"Oh?" Zhu Changlan's eyes sharpened, "Is he still here now?"

"He should have left already." Daoist Xuanchen shook his head, "Although the black qi on the altar is thick, it no longer has a fresh aura, clearly it hasn't been activated for some time. Looking at the dissipation of this black qi, the教主's residual soul should have left three to five days ago, heading deep into the Hundred Thousand Mountains."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his gaze sweeping over the altar, suddenly discovering a black token in the corner of the altar. He reached out and picked up the token, which was cold to the touch, with the Black Bone Cult's skull symbol carved on it, and several strange runes carved below the symbol. "The runes on this token seem to be some kind of contact code." Zhu Changlan said, handing the token to Daoist Xuanchen.

Daoist Xuanchen took the token, looked at it carefully for a moment, then nodded: "My Lord is right, this is a contact token within the Black Bone Cult. Different runes represent different strongholds and contact methods. We can follow the residual aura on the token to track the whereabouts of the Black Bone Cult Leader."

"Good." Zhu Changlan put the token away, "This place is not suitable for long stay. Let's leave the cave first, find a safe place to rest for the night, and tomorrow continue tracking along the token's aura."

## IV. Rest and Tracking: Clues Emerge, Killing Intent Rises Again

Everyone left the cave, finding a flat, open area on the outskirts of the Black Wind Forest to set up temporary tents. Little Luzi lit a fire and boiled hot soup. Everyone drank the hot soup, ate some dry food, and treated their wounds before resting separately.

The next morning, just as dawn was breaking, everyone packed their luggage. Led by Daoist Xuanchen holding the black token, they followed the residual aura on the token, heading deeper into the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Deep in the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the terrain became more complex, with no decent roads at all. They could only trek through dense forests and steep mountain walls. The trees here were taller and sturdier, with branches and leaves so intertwined that sunlight could hardly penetrate, leaving the area permanently shrouded in dimness. The demonic energy in the air was so thick it was almost tangible, mixed with the smell of rotting flesh and miasma. Every breath felt like a pain in the lungs. Along the way, animal and human bones could be seen everywhere, some still with broken weapons stuck in them, clearly the remains of past adventurers or cultivators who had died unfortunately.

"My Lord, look ahead!" Daoist Xuanchen suddenly stopped, pointing to a valley not far ahead, his voice grave.

Zhu Changlan followed his finger, looking ahead. The valley was shrouded in mist, which was a faint black color, clearly a mixture of demonic energy and miasma. Black qi churned above the valley, and indistinct outlines of many simple wooden houses could be seen inside, clearly another stronghold of the Black Bone Cult. More importantly, the aura from the token was heading towards that valley.

"It seems we've found the right place." Zhu Changlan's eyes turned cold, his voice lowered, "This stronghold is much larger than the cave in Black Wind Forest, and there must be many demonic creatures inside. Daoist Xuanchen, take three disciples and go around to the west side of the valley, hiding on the hillside. The other two disciples will follow me, along with the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members, to attack from the front, attracting the attention of the demonic creatures. When we launch the attack, you charge down from the hillside, attacking from both front and back, wiping out the demonic creatures in one fell swoop."

"Good!" Daoist Xuanchen replied, immediately taking three disciples and quietly circling towards the west side of the valley.

Zhu Changlan led two Qingyun Temple disciples and twenty Jin Yiwei Dark Division members, carefully approaching the front of the valley. At the entrance of the valley stood two huge rocks, forming a natural barrier, with two tall demonic creature guards standing by the rocks. These two demonic creatures had human bodies and leopard heads, covered with yellow fur, holding huge wolf-tooth clubs in their hands. Their eyes scanned the surroundings vigilantly, their bodies covered with thick black qi, clearly not low in cultivation.

"Stop! Who is it? Daring to enter the territory of Black Wind Valley!" The left leopard-headed demon saw Zhu Changlan and the others, shouting sharply, his wolf-tooth club slamming heavily on the ground, making a "dong" sound.

"The ones who will take your lives!" Zhu Changlan shouted coldly, his figure flashing like a golden bolt of lightning, charging towards the left leopard-headed demon. The wooden sword, wrapped in sharp golden demonic power, stabbed straight at the leopard-headed demon's chest.

The leopard-headed demon didn't expect Zhu Changlan to suddenly attack, a flash of panic in its eyes. It quickly waved its wolf-tooth club, blocking towards the wooden sword. "Dang!" The wooden sword collided with the wolf-tooth club, sparks flying. The leopard-headed demon only felt its arm go numb, the wolf-tooth club almost slipping from its hand, secretly shocked: This human's strength is so formidable!

At the same time, the right leopard-headed demon was surrounded by Jin Yiwei Dark Division members, engaged in fierce combat. The two Qingyun Temple disciples stood guard, preventing other demonic creatures from reinforcing.

Zhu Changlan didn't give the left leopard-headed demon a chance to catch its breath, his wrist flipping, the wooden sword drawing a sharp arc, slashing towards the leopard-headed demon's neck. The leopard-headed demon quickly lowered its head to avoid, the wooden sword scraping its head, cutting off a tuft of yellow fur. The leopard-headed demon was both shocked and angry, roaring, the black qi around its body surging, the wolf-tooth club带着浓郁 evil qi, slamming towards Zhu Changlan's head.

Zhu Changlan's steps shifted, his figure moving like a ghost to avoid the attack. At the same time, the wooden sword顺势 upward, golden demonic power suddenly bursting forth, piercing through the leopard-headed demon's shoulder. "Oww!" The leopard-headed demon let out a scream, knowing it was no match for Zhu Changlan, turning to run.

How could Zhu Changlan give it a chance? His figure flashed, blocking its path, the wooden sword stabbing out again, accurately piercing its heart. The leopard-headed demon's body stiffened, the light in its eyes gradually fading, crashing to the ground, completely dead.

On the other side, the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members had also dealt with the other leopard-headed demon. Zhu Changlan waved his hand, leading everyone to charge into the valley.

Inside the valley, simple wooden houses were scattered, with many残缺兽 skins and bones drying around them. The demonic energy and smell of blood were even stronger. In the center of the valley was a huge square, paved with stones into a huge evil array. Hundreds of demonic creatures were sitting cross-legged around the array, absorbing the evil qi emanating from it. Black qi surrounded their bodies, clearly practicing evil arts.

Hearing the commotion at the entrance, the demonic creatures opened their eyes one after another, stopping their cultivation. Their eyes flashed with bloodthirsty light as they surrounded Zhu Changlan and the others. "Humans, you have such audacity, daring to break in!" A tall demonic creature walked out, with a human body and lion head, covered with brown mane, holding a huge mountain-splitting axe in its hand. Its eyes were fierce as it stared at Zhu Changlan, clearly the leader of this stronghold.

"Remnants of the Black Bone Cult, today is your last day!" Zhu Changlan shouted coldly,提着 his wooden sword, charging towards the lion-headed demon.

The lion-headed demon roared, swinging its mountain-splitting axe, charging towards Zhu Changlan. The mountain-splitting axe, wrapped in thick black qi, collided with the wooden sword, making a "dang" sound. Zhu Changlan only felt a huge force coming, his arm numb, his body retreating five steps before steadying himself, secretly shocked: This lion-headed demon's strength is even more formidable than the previous wild boar demon, with cultivation of at least five hundred years!

Just then, shouts of battle came from the hillside on the west side of the valley. Daoist Xuanchen, leading three disciples, charged down from the hillside. Golden talismans rained down on the demonic creature group, and in an instant, many demonic creatures were hit by the talismans, turning to ashes.

The demonic creatures didn't expect an ambush, immediately panicking. Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, charging towards the lion-headed demon again, his wooden sword挥舞得密不透风. The golden sword light collided with the lion-headed demon's black qi, emitting耀眼 light.

The lion-headed demon was both shocked and angry, while blocking Zhu Changlan's attacks, roaring to command other demonic creatures to counterattack. But at this point, the demonic creatures were in disarray, and under the joint attack of the Jin Yiwei Dark Division and Qingyun Temple disciples, they continued to fall, their screams echoing endlessly.

Zhu Changlan was entangled with the lion-headed demon. The lion-headed demon's mountain-splitting axe was extremely powerful, and every swing carried a destructive momentum. The rocks around were shattered into powder by the axe wind. Zhu Changlan relied on his nimble body to constantly dodge attacks, looking for the lion-headed demon's flaws. He found that although the lion-headed demon was strong, its lower body was unstable, which was its weakness.

"Roar!" The lion-headed demon, seeing its attacks repeatedly miss and being forced to retreat by Zhu Changlan, was completely enraged. The black qi around its body surged, forming a black whirlwind that swept up surrounding demonic creatures, instantly turning them into blood water, which was absorbed into its body. Its size became even larger, and its eyes became more疯狂, swinging its mountain-splitting axe fiercely towards Zhu Changlan. The axe wind carried a strong suction, trying to pull Zhu Changlan into the whirlwind.

Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, channeling all his demonic power, forming a solid shield around his body with golden demonic power. Instead of dodging, he charged towards the whirlwind, kicking off the ground, his body suddenly rising, avoiding the mountain-splitting axe attack, while the wooden sword, with golden demonic power, stabbed towards the lion-headed demon's knee!

"Puchi!" The wooden sword accurately pierced the lion-headed demon's knee, dark green blood gushing out. The lion-headed demon let out a凄厉 scream, its knee giving way, falling to one knee, its huge body losing balance.

Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, landing behind the lion-headed demon, the wooden sword stabbing backward, with golden demonic power, accurately piercing the lion-headed demon's back heart. "Oww------" The lion-headed demon let out its final scream, its huge body crashing to the ground, twitching a few times before dying, the black qi and whirlwind around its body gradually dissipating.

After dealing with the lion-headed demon, Zhu Changlan turned to join the battle, helping Daoist Xuanchen, Jin Yiwei Dark Division members clean up the remaining demonic creatures. Without their leader, the demonic creatures were even more vulnerable, and before long, all the demonic creatures in the valley were completely eliminated.

The battle ended, and the valley was in a mess. The ground was covered with the bodies of demonic creatures, their dark green blood staining the entire square. The smell of blood and decay in the air was nauseating. Zhu Changlan, Daoist Xuanchen, and the others had all consumed a lot of energy, and their wounds had reopened due to the fierce battle, oozing blood.

"My Lord, are you all right?" Daoist Xuanchen stepped forward, handing Zhu Changlan a bottle of healing medicine.

"I'm fine." Zhu Changlan took the medicine bottle, pouring out one and swallowing it. His gaze fell on the largest wooden house in the center of the valley, "That wooden house should be the lion-headed demon's residence. Let's check it out; we might find clues about the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul."

The two entered the wooden house, which was simply furnished, with only a stone bed, a stone table, and a few stone chairs. On the stone table were a black leather account book and a folded letter. Zhu Changlan picked up the letter and unfolded it to read carefully.

The handwriting on the letter was scrawled and twisted, carrying a thick evil aura, clearly written by a Black Bone Cult demonic creature. The content of the letter was about the whereabouts of the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul—after the battle at Kunlun Mountain, the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul was severely injured, fleeing all the way to the Hundred Thousand Mountains. He successively cultivated and recuperated in the Black Wind Forest cave and Black Wind Valley stronghold. However, the evil qi in these two places was insufficient to support his rapid recovery, so he left three to five days ago, heading to the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, the deepest part of the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The Ten Thousand Demon Cave is the most demonic energy-rich place in the Hundred Thousand Mountains, where countless powerful demonic creatures盘踞. The Black Bone Cult Leader plans to absorb the pure demonic energy of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave to quickly recover from his injuries, then gather the remnants of the Black Bone Cult from all over, make a comeback, take revenge on Zhu Changlan and the Crown Prince, and seize the Source of Spiritual Veins.

"Ten Thousand Demon Cave." Zhu Changlan clenched the letter, his eyes becoming more determined, "It seems we must go to the Ten Thousand Demon Cave to completely eliminate this residual soul, to avoid future troubles."

Daoist Xuanchen nodded, his face grave: "The Ten Thousand Demon Cave is the core of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the most dangerous place. Not only is the demonic energy there extremely浓郁, but there are also countless ancient demonic creatures that have cultivated for thousands of years, not to mention the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul lying in wait. This trip will bring unprecedented danger."

"No matter how dangerous it is, we must go." Zhu Changlan's tone was firm, "To protect the Source of Spiritual Veins, to protect Brother Emperor and the Ming Dynasty, even if it's a mountain of knives and a sea of fire, I will not hesitate."

## V. Deep into Danger: Before the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, Undercurrents Surge

Everyone rested in Black Wind Valley for two days, healing their injuries, replenishing enough dry food and water, then set off towards the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, taking the letter and black token with them.

The Ten Thousand Demon Cave is located in the deepest part of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, hidden in the belly of a huge mountain, a naturally formed enormous karst cave. The demonic energy along the way became more and more浓郁, almost suffocating. The roads were even more rugged and steep, covered with sharp rocks and slippery moss. One carelessness could lead to falling into an abyss. Many places on the rocks were covered with a layer of black mucus, emitting a pungent fishy smell, clearly traces left by powerful demonic creatures.

After three days of travel, they finally arrived at the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave. The scene before them made everyone gasp—the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave was enormous, about ten zhang high and five zhang wide, like a giant mouth opening to devour everything around it. The rocks around the entrance were pitch black, covered with strange runes, with dense black qi surrounding the runes, forming a black barrier that emitted a terrifying oppressive force. Around the entrance were scattered countless animal and human bones, piled up like mountains, some still faintly emitting black qi, clearly having been sucked dry of blood by demonic creatures not long ago.

"My Lord, this is the Ten Thousand Demon Cave." Daoist Xuanchen's voice carried a hint of gravity, "The demonic energy inside has become so thick it's substantial. A slight carelessness could lead to the erosion of the spiritual consciousness, becoming a madman."

Zhu Changlan gripped his wooden sword tightly, his eyes firm: "No matter how dangerous it is, we must go in. Daoist Xuanchen, take your disciples and the Jin Yiwei Dark Division members to set up defenses outside the entrance. I'll go in first to investigate the situation. Once I find the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul, I'll crush the signal talisman, and you can come in to support."

"No! My Lord, the Ten Thousand Demon Cave is too dangerous. You going alone is too risky." Daoist Xuanchen quickly dissuaded, "Why don't I go in with you, so we can look out for each other?"

"No need." Zhu Changlan shook his head, "The terrain inside the Ten Thousand Demon Cave is complex, with crisscrossing caves, like a huge maze. Too many people would easily expose their whereabouts and drag each other down. My true form is a Snow Spirit Cat, skilled at concealing aura and exploring the environment. Going alone is more secure. Your接应 outside is the greatest help to me."

He paused, taking out the last clay pot of fish jerky from his luggage, pulling out the stopper. The rich fish jerky aroma instantly filled the air, in stark contrast to the surrounding demonic energy: "This is the last pot of fish jerky. I'll put it at the entrance to lure the guards inside. After the guards come out, I'll take the opportunity to enter the Ten Thousand Demon Cave and investigate the internal situation."

Daoist Xuanchen saw he was resolute and knew he couldn't be persuaded, so he nodded: "My Lord, please be careful. If you encounter danger, don't force yourself. Send the signal immediately, and we'll come in to support you at the first time."

"Good." Zhu Changlan replied, carrying the fish jerky to a huge rock at the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, pouring all the fish jerky onto the rock, then quickly retreating to the side of the entrance, holding his breath and quietly observing the entrance.

The rich, salty aroma of the fish jerky quickly spread in the thick demonic energy, like a beacon attracting the demonic creatures inside. Before long, a dull thumping sound came from inside the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, like a huge creature moving. The footsteps grew clearer from far to near, making the ground tremble slightly.

Zhu Changlan gripped his wooden sword tightly, his eyes alertly fixed on the entrance. He could feel an extremely powerful demonic aura approaching the entrance, stronger than all the demonic creatures encountered before, clearly a powerful guard of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave.

After a moment, the black qi at the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave churned violently, and a huge demonic creature slowly walked out. Its entire body was covered with dark black scales, glowing with a metallic sheen, comparable in size to an elephant. Its head was a huge lizard head, its mouth opening to reveal rows of sharp fangs, and a pair of blood-red vertical pupils staring fixedly at the fish jerky on the rock, emitting a bloodthirsty light. A thick tail dragged behind it, with a sharp bone spur at the end, glowing dark purple, clearly dipped in deadly poison. Its four limbs were thick and powerful, its claws sharp as knives, leaving deep claw marks on the rock with every step.

This is a thousand-year-old scaled lizard demon! Zhu Changlan was secretly shocked. This kind of demonic creature already possesses considerable intelligence, with cultivation reaching the thousand-year realm, extremely powerful.

The scaled lizard demon has an extremely sensitive sense of smell. As soon as it walked out of the entrance, it was attracted by the fish jerky aroma on the rock. Its blood-red vertical pupils locked onto the fish jerky, dragging its heavy body slowly towards it. Its movements seemed slow, but carried a suffocating sense of oppression, and the air around it seemed to freeze under its aura.

Zhu Changlan held his breath, his gaze fixed on the scaled lizard demon's movements. This lizard demon's scales are extremely hard, ordinary attacks cannot penetrate them, only its eyes, abdomen, and throat are weak points. He planned to wait for the lizard demon to lower its head to eat the fish jerky, relaxing its vigilance, then launch a surprise attack, first blinding its eyes, then subduing it, forcing it to reveal the exact location of the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul in the Ten Thousand Demon Cave.

Just as the scaled lizard demon lowered its head and extended its tongue to wrap around the fish jerky, Zhu Changlan moved! His figure was like a golden flash of lightning, suddenly darting out from behind the rock. His周身 demonic power surged to the extreme, the wooden sword completely wrapped in golden demonic power, tearing through the air with a sharp whistle, stabbing straight at the scaled lizard demon's left eye!

The scaled lizard demon clearly didn't expect an ambush, its blood-red vertical pupils suddenly contracting. It subconsciously raised its front claw, blocking towards the wooden sword. "Dang!" A deafening collision sound rang out, sparks flying. The wooden sword hit the lizard demon's claw hard, bouncing back. Zhu Changlan only felt a sharp pain in his arm, his body being thrown back seven or eight steps by the huge impact before steadying himself, his虎口 even cracking, blood dripping from his fingertips. The black qi at the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave was stirred into chaos by this violent collision, mixing with the dust raised by broken stones, forming a chaotic gray mist in the dim light. This scaled lizard demon's defense is so strong! Zhu Changlan was shocked, but didn't dare to hesitate for a moment. The scaled lizard demon had been completely enraged, its blood-red vertical pupils locking onto him, emitting a deafening roar. The black qi around its body surged疯狂, its thick tail, like a steel whip, swept fiercely towards him with a howling wind. This tail strike carried a thousand jin of force,裹挟ing the cold demonic energy from deep within the cave. If hit, it would surely break his bones and tendons. Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, his demonic power bursting from his feet, his figure floating to the side like catkins, narrowly avoiding the tail attack. "Boom!" The tail hit the rock where he had just stood, instantly shattering it into powder. The broken stones, mixed with piles of bone debris, flew everywhere, hitting the surrounding black stone walls with a crackling sound. Using the momentum of his drift, he quickly pulled away from the lizard demon, his back accidentally hitting a岩壁 covered with strange runes. The cold touch spread along his spine, making him more awake. Cold sweat broke out in his palm gripping the wooden sword, his mind racing to think of a solution.

This lizard demon not only has amazing defense, but also霸道 unmatched strength. A direct confrontation is absolutely impossible to win. Zhu Changlan's gaze quickly scanned the lizard demon's body, landing on the area on its abdomen with lighter color and sparser scales—that was its weak point, but it was blocked by its thick limbs, making it extremely difficult to hit. He took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing the pain in his arm, and his周身 golden demonic power flowed again, colliding with the surrounding thick black demonic energy to produce细碎 light屑. This time, he didn't rush to attack, but his feet tapped lightly, leaving several golden afterimages in place, starting to circle the lizard demon quickly. The ground under his feet was covered with sharp rocks, slippery moss, and many bone remains. Every step required careful attention. The scaled lizard demon, enraged by his movements, roared and turned its head, its blood-red vertical pupils flashing fiercely in the dim environment. Its thick tail continuously swept around, and wherever it swept, rocks broke, bones flew,掀起 bursts of foul-smelling airflow, trying to force him to stop. But Zhu Changlan's figure was like a ghost, always able to avoid attacks at the last moment. His feet stepped on the bone pile to borrow strength, while一点点 closing the distance to the lizard demon's abdomen.

The scaled lizard demon, seeing that it could never touch Zhu Changlan, the violence in its red vertical pupils almost overflowed. It suddenly stopped rotating its body, its huge body sinking abruptly, its four limbs firmly蹬ing the ground, breaking stones and bone debris under its weight. The next second, it lunged forward with a howling wind, its tail sweeping towards him like a steel whip. The wind carried the stench of decay, and if hit, it would surely break his bones. Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, and he kicked off the ground, his body suddenly rising, narrowly avoiding the tail attack. "Boom!" The tail hit the rock wall behind him, causing a large piece of rock to collapse, falling towards him. He quickly dodged, but still got hit by a small piece of rock, causing a sharp pain in his shoulder. He gritted his teeth, enduring the pain, and continued to circle the lizard demon, looking for an opportunity to attack.

Finally, the scaled lizard demon lost its patience with the chase. It suddenly turned around, its huge body lunging forward, its mouth wide open, revealing rows of sharp fangs, and bit down fiercely towards Zhu Changlan's head! At this critical moment, Zhu Changlan suddenly ducked, his body sliding forward along the ground, passing between the lizard demon's legs, and at the same time, his wooden sword stabbed upward with all his strength, aiming at the lizard demon's abdomen!

"Puchi!" The wooden sword pierced into the lizard demon's abdomen, but only went in an inch before getting stuck—the scales there, though sparser, were still extremely hard. The severe pain made the lizard demon let out a deafening roar, its front limbs slamming down towards the ground, creating a shockwave that sent Zhu Changlan flying, crashing into the rock wall behind him. He spat out a mouthful of blood, his back aching, and his vision blurred for a moment. The lizard demon's tail swept towards him again, and he quickly rolled to the side, narrowly avoiding it. The tail hit the rock wall, shattering it into pieces, and the debris flew everywhere, hitting him and causing more injuries.

Zhu Changlan struggled to get up, his body covered in cuts and bruises, his breathing ragged. The lizard demon's eyes glinted with cruelty as it slowly approached, its tail dragging on the ground, leaving deep marks. It seemed to want to toy with him before delivering the final blow. Zhu Changlan's hand悄悄摸向 his waist, where he had hidden a few Clear Heart Talismans—this was his only chance now.

Just as the lizard demon opened its mouth to bite him again, Zhu Changlan suddenly threw a Clear Heart Talisman at its face. The talisman exploded in mid-air, emitting a brilliant golden light that momentarily blinded the lizard demon. It let out a痛苦的嘶鸣, its body staggering back. Zhu Changlan seized this opportunity, his body leaping forward, his wooden sword stabbing into the lizard demon's eye with all his remaining strength!

"Puchi!" The wooden sword pierced through the lizard demon's eye, deep into its skull. The lizard demon let out a blood-curdling scream, its body thrashing wildly, hitting the rock walls and ground with great force. Zhu Changlan held onto the wooden sword tightly, his body being thrown around, but he didn't let go. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the lizard demon's movements slowed down, and it collapsed to the ground with a loud thud, its body twitching slightly before becoming still.

Zhu Changlan collapsed to the ground, exhausted. His body was covered in injuries, his clothes were torn and bloody, and his breathing was shallow. But he had succeeded—he had defeated the scaled lizard demon, and now he could enter the Ten Thousand Demon Cave to search for the Black Bone Cult Leader's residual soul.

With great difficulty, he stood up, picked up his wooden sword, and staggered towards the entrance of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave. The black qi inside the cave was thick and oppressive, but he didn't hesitate. He took a deep breath, stepped into the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, and disappeared into the darkness.

(End of Chapter 9)
