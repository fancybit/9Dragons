The 25th year of the Wanli era, spring was in full bloom with clear skies and warm sunshine.

The side hall of Xian'an Palace, located on the western route of the inner court of the Forbidden City, had always been the quietest place in the entire palace. Originally the residence of a former imperial concubine, this palace was specially renovated by the emperor as a residence for Zhu Changlan after he was adopted by the empress. The main hall of Xian'an Palace hung a plaque inscribed with "Ci'an" (慈安), written by the empress herself. The interior was simply and elegantly furnished, with calligraphy and paintings from famous artists and four treasures of the study presented as tributes from the south, reflecting the empress's love and expectations for him. Unlike the bustling East Palace or the noisy Yikun Palace, even the palace eunuchs and maids who passed by on the palace road walked with extremely light steps, as if afraid of disturbing the master of this side hall
------ the current Ninth Prince, Zhu Changlan.

Oh, no, the palace people privately called him "Ninth Prince," but he preferred others to call him "Xuan Yu True Man" or the more intimate "Little Nine." However, in this palace, very few people dared to call him that anymore.

It was nearly 10 o'clock in the morning, and the sun had risen over the palace walls, casting dappled light through the carved window lattices onto the blue brick floor. In the courtyard of the side hall, several old osmanthus trees had just sprouted new leaves, their tender green branches swaying gently in the breeze, filling the air with a faint fragrance of grass and trees. Several clusters of orchids grew at the foot of the wall, with lush green leaves, transplanted by Zhu Changlan himself, said to be from the spiritual valley at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, carrying a natural elegance that allowed them to grow luxuriantly even in the depths of the palace. In the center of the courtyard, that pear wood reclining chair was his favorite. The wood was top-quality old pear wood, air-dried for three years and carefully carved by the best carpenter in the capital according to his design. The armrests were carved with interlocking lotus patterns, with smooth lines and unfolding petals. When approached, one could smell the warm fragrance of the wood itself, mixed with the scent of grass and trees in the courtyard, bringing an inexplicable sense of peace.

Zhu Changlan was reclining on the chair, sleeping soundly. He was covered with a plain silk blanket, on which were embroidered dark gold interlocking lotus patterns, one of his few favorite intricate decorations. After all, who could resist something golden? The warm sunlight bathed his body, outlining the contours of his refined profile. At the age of 24, a man at the prime of his life, he was extremely handsome. His eyebrows were like distant mountains veiled in mist, his eyes like autumn waters reflecting waves, his nose high and straight, his lips distinct, and his skin was as fair as if he had never been exposed to the scorching sun. Only those eyes were now slightly closed, with long, dense eyelashes casting a small shadow under his eyelids, adding a touch of laziness and casualness.

He wasn't sleeping peacefully, occasionally smacking his lips lightly, sometimes furrowing his brows, his fingertips curling up unconsciously and then slowly spreading out, his knuckles slightly pale, like a cat retracting and extending its claws in a dream, with a hint of unconscious coquettishness. This was a habit he had since childhood, and even after transmigrating into a human form for many years, the feline nature in his bones had never faded. Sometimes when he slept deeply, he would unconsciously let out an extremely soft purr, as faint as a mosquito's hum, which, paired with his handsome face, exuded a charming contrast. Occasionally, he would tilt his head slightly, rubbing his cheek against the soft pillow, just like a cat rubbing its owner's palm to act coquettish.

"Meow～"
A very soft and gentle cat meow escaped from his throat, almost blending with the birdsong outside the courtyard. Xiaoluzi, the young eunuch standing guard beside him, was already accustomed to it, and only lightened his steps to add some calming sandalwood to the incense burner. This sandalwood was specially obtained from the Western Regions by Zhu Changlan, with hard texture and mellow fragrance. When lit, the smoke column was straight, never dispersing, which could calm the mind and stabilize the qi. Xiaoluzi also特意 placed a small dish of clear water beside the incense burner, saying it could make the sandalwood fragrance more gentle. This method was taught to him by Zhu Changlan, who said, "Metaphysical health preservation lies in the details."

Xiaoluzi had been with Zhu Changlan since entering the palace, and it had been five years now. Originally a child from a farmer's family in the suburbs of Beijing, his parents died early, and he was sent to serve in Xian'an Palace. Due to his calm and meticulous nature, and his reluctance to gossip, he gradually became Zhu Changlan's most capable person. This Ninth Prince seemed idle and indifferent, detached from worldly affairs, but in reality, he was perceptive and intelligent. He saw through all the open and hidden conflicts in the imperial court and the palace's intrigues, but was always too lazy to get involved. After all, his biological mother died early, leaving him with no backing, and the emperor paid no attention to him. In this deep palace, only by pretending to be an "ignorant, pleasure-seeking idle prince" could he avoid those whirlpools and live in peace.

Take the arrangement of Xian'an Palace as an example, every detail reflected the prince's "idleness." On the bookshelf in his study, half were collections of poetry, music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, while the other half were esoteric books like "Classic of Mountains and Seas" and "Baopuzi," along with some miscellaneous books on carpentry and tea art. On the desk sat a wooden pen holder he made himself, shaped like a curled-up cat, lifelike. The brush holder contained several writing brushes with rounded tips, which were ordinary goat hair brushes, not rare treasures from famous masters. A soft pillow was placed on the couch, embroidered with a napping cat, which he asked the embroidery maids of Xian'an Palace to make, saying that sleeping on it could help him dream of his hometown at the foot of Kunlun Mountain.

"My Prince, it's time to wake up. If you sleep any longer, you might miss the lunch."
Xiaoluzi called out softly, his voice so low it was like fearing to startle a bird on the branch. In his hand, he held a bowl of warm refreshing soup, brewed with licorice, dried tangerine peel, and lotus seeds, neither bitter nor astringent, with a faint sweet taste, perfect for waking someone from deep sleep. This recipe was also formulated by Zhu Changlan himself, saying that spring is humid, and drinking this can strengthen the spleen and dispel dampness without damaging the spleen and stomach.

Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, with a hint of confusion from just waking up, his eyes bleary with a touch of moisture. He stretched lazily, his movements elegant, his shoulder blades slightly opening and closing, just like a cat that had enjoyed the afternoon sun, exuding a sense of laziness all over. "Hmm......
Such a good day, it's a pity to sleep through it."
His tone was soft and糯, with a hint of hoarseness from just waking up, the end of his voice rising slightly, naturally carrying a three-point smile, which made people's hearts warm when they heard it.

He sat up, and the thin blanket slid off his body, revealing an ivory-white brocade robe inside, with fine silver cloud patterns embroidered on the collar and cuffs. The stitches were dense, embroidered by the embroidery maids of Xian'an Palace according to his requirements ------ not too ostentatious, but not losing the dignity of a prince. Xiaoluzi quickly stepped forward, presented the refreshing soup, and picked up a jade comb to gently comb his slightly messy long hair. Zhu Changlan let him take care of him, his gaze falling on the newly sprouted osmanthus tree in the courtyard, and asked calmly, "Is there anything interesting in the palace today?"

No trace of curiosity could be heard, as if it was just casual conversation.

Xiaoluzi replied while combing, "Returning to Your Highness, this morning, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince sent some newly made pastries, saying they were sweet-scented osmanthus cakes tribute from the south. He knew you like them and specially saved a portion for you. Also, this afternoon, His Majesty will hold a banquet in the Imperial Garden to entertain several envoys from vassal states, and all palace princes are invited to accompany him."
He paused, then added, "The person sent by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince also said that if you are too lazy to attend the banquet, he will cover for you in front of His Majesty, saying you have a slight cold."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan raised his eyebrows, a hint of warmth flashing in his eyes, then returning to indifference. "The Crown Prince is really thoughtful."
He said softly, his fingertips unconsciously caressing the wooden armrest of the chair. In this cold palace, Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was the only one who treated him sincerely. When he first transmigrated into the palace as a young child, his biological mother, Zhang Youxuan, was poisoned and died early by Consort Zheng and the Black Bone Sect. Zhang Youxuan was originally a palace maid during the Wanli era, from a family of Taoist practitioners, with deep connections to the Qingyun Temple. Due to her outstanding cultivation talent, she was jealous of Consort Zheng, and ultimately met a tragic end. Her early death caused the emperor to ignore him, and the palace eunuchs and maids, seeing which way the wind was blowing, often neglected him. Once, he was secretly wiping his tears in a corner of the Imperial Garden, missing the grassy scent at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, when the Crown Prince撞见 him. The Crown Prince didn't ask much, just silently sat with him, and even stuffed his favorite wooden rattle into his hand, saying, "Ninth Brother, I will protect you from now on."
He remembered this kindness for three hundred years, even after reincarnation, he never forgot.

The Crown Prince knew he liked wooden things, and last year specially gave him a set of red sandalwood tea utensils, with hard texture and fine grain, which Zhu Changlan cherished very much, only taking them out on important days. The sweet-scented osmanthus cakes sent this time were also his favorite. The Crown Prince always remembered his preferences clearly.

As for the banquet in the Imperial Garden, he originally didn't want to go. At such occasions, it was nothing more than the emperor showing off his power, officials flattering each other, and vassal envoys being hypocritical. It was really boring. Moreover, he was never good at socializing, and was too lazy to look at those people's hypocritical faces. But on second thought, the Crown Prince's influence in the court had gradually grown, long attracting the jealousy of Consort Zheng and several princes. If he openly absented himself, it might bring the Crown Prince the criticism of "indulging his brother, disregarding the imperial order."

"Got it, have the carriage ready by then."
He said calmly, his tone carrying a hint of helplessness. After all, it was an imperial order. Although he was not favored, he couldn't openly defy it, let alone cause trouble for the Crown Prince.

Xiaoluzi responded, then asked, "My Prince, the sweet-scented osmanthus cakes are still warm in the side hall. Would you like to try them now?"

Zhu Changlan nodded, "Sure."
He indeed liked sweet-scented osmanthus cakes, especially those tribute from the south, which used newly picked golden osmanthus of the year and top-quality fine white sugar, sweet but not cloying, with a faint osmanthus fragrance, paired with Lapsang Souchong tea, it was absolutely perfect.

Soon, Xiaoluzi came in with a plate of sweet-scented osmanthus cakes. The pastries were neatly arranged on a pear wood tray, golden in color, with a few dried osmanthus flowers decorating the edges, emitting a rich osmanthus fragrance and rice aroma. Zhu Changlan picked up a piece, took a gentle bite, and the soft, sweet taste melted on his tongue, with the osmanthus fragrance lingering at the tip of his nose, making him involuntarily squint his eyes and reveal a satisfied expression. "Hmm, the Crown Prince really understands me."
He smiled and said, picking up another piece to slowly taste. After eating two pieces, he felt a bit腻, and Xiaoluzi timely brought a cup of freshly brewed Lapsang Souchong tea.

Zhu Changlan took the tea cup, his fingertips touching the warm purple sand cup wall, and his heart felt warm. This tea cup was an old purple sand cup he specially found, with excellent air permeability, which could maximize the mellow fragrance of Lapsang Souchong. He had always loved drinking Lapsang Souchong, not liking overly light green tea, nor favoring strong Pu'er tea, only being fond of the mellow aftertaste of Lapsang Souchong. It was said that this tea was carefully roasted by tea farmers at the foot of Wuyi Mountain, with a unique pine smoke fragrance. He fell in love with it the first time he drank it, and specially had a small tea garden opened in the backyard of Xian'an Palace. Although it couldn't replicate the flavor of Wuyi Mountain tea, it could satisfy his craving.

The water for making tea was also particular. He asked Xiaoluzi to fetch the first bucket of water from the ancient well in the Imperial Garden every early morning, saying,
"Morning dew melts into well water, the water quality is clear and cool, most suitable for highlighting the tea fragrance." When brewing, the water temperature should be just boiling, not too hot nor too cold. When pouring, it should be slowly poured along the edge of the tea cup, not directly rushing onto the tea leaves, saying this can make the tea fragrance slowly release. Zhu Changlan also enjoyed playing with the teapot, wiping the pot body with tea soup. Over time, that purple sand pot became smooth and shiny with a warm color, becoming his treasure.

While eating the refreshments, a sound of footsteps suddenly came from outside the courtyard, accompanied by the soft whispers of palace maids. Zhu Changlan looked up and saw a palace maid in light green palace clothes, cautiously peeking inside, her expression carrying a hint of restraint.

"What's the matter?"
Xiaoluzi stepped forward, blocking the maid's view, and asked in a deep voice.

The maid quickly bowed and saluted, "Returning to His Highness the Ninth Prince, returning to Eunuch Xiaoluzi, it's Eunuch Cui from Consort Zheng's palace, saying that Consort Zheng invites His Highness to come over, there's something important to discuss."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan paused, a hint of confusion flashing in his eyes. Consort Zheng had never had any friendship with him, and even because he was close to the Crown Prince, she often sneered at him, regarding him as an "idle附庸" beside the Crown Prince. Why would she suddenly invite him over today? He put down the sweet-scented osmanthus cake, wiped his mouth with a brocade handkerchief, and said slowly, "Got it, this Prince will go later."
He remained calm, his tone still flat, as if going to an ordinary invitation.

The maid responded, bowed, and quickly left, her steps hurried, as if afraid to stay a second longer.

Xiaoluzi looked at Zhu Changlan worriedly, "My Prince, it can't be a good thing that Consort Zheng suddenly wants to see you. You must be careful. I heard a few days ago that people from Consort Zheng's palace were inquiring about your whereabouts, and also asking about who you usually associate with."

Zhu Changlan smiled and patted Xiaoluzi's shoulder, "It's okay, soldiers come to block, water comes to soil cover. Can she eat this Prince?"
His tone was relaxed, with a hint of joke, but his eyes hid a sharp edge that was hard to detect. Having lived in this deep palace for so many years, he had long learned to use jokes to defuse tensions, and also learned to hide his sharpness under a seemingly gentle exterior. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, what kind of conspiracy had he not seen? Consort Zheng's little schemes were nothing but child's play in his eyes.

He picked up a round fan nearby and gently fanned himself. The fan bones were made of tough chicken wing wood, and the fan surface was painted with ink landscape, which he painted himself. Distant mountains were like ink, near water with mist, and a lazy cat lying on a rock in the sun, exactly the free life he yearned for. The inscription on the fan was "Xuan Yu," written in a graceful and casual style. On ordinary days, when he had nothing to do, he liked to draw and write, not to become famous, but for his own entertainment. On the wall of his study hung several of his paintings, all of landscapes, flowers, and birds, as well as a few sketches of cats, each with different forms, lifelike.

"Xiaoluzi, help this Prince change clothes." He said.

Xiaoluzi quickly responded, turning to fetch clothes. Zhu Changlan stood up, stretched his body, and habitually curled his fingertips, feeling the warmth of the sun. Consort Zheng was looking for him, most likely for the banquet in the afternoon. That "master of physiognomy" brought by the vassal envoy was probably not simple. Consort Zheng had always been jealous of the Crown Prince, and perhaps wanted to use this master's hand to either test his background or create trouble for the Crown Prince.

However, he had always been too lazy to get involved in these palace and court disputes. He just wanted to be his idle prince in peace, drinking tea, reading books, sunbathing, drinking a cup of rice wine at night, falling asleep to the sound of insects, and occasionally chatting with the Crown Prince. Such a life was his idea of perfection. But in this deep palace, there was never true peace. The tree desires calm but the wind does not cease. Some things cannot be avoided even if you want to.

Soon, Xiaoluzi brought a dark cyan brocade robe. This brocade robe was made of southern tribute brocade, with soft texture and calm color. The collar was embroidered with a circle of dark gold cloud patterns, which neither lost the prince's identity nor was too ostentatious. Zhu Changlan put on the robe, and adjusted his collar in front of the bronze mirror. The man in the mirror had a handsome face and a gentle temperament, but his eyes hid a sense of alienation and laziness from seeing through the world. Looking at the mirror, he unconsciously mimicked a cat meow, "Meow～" The sound was soft, completely incompatible with his current attire, but he couldn't help laughing.

He also specially took out a jade pendant and tied it around his waist. This jade pendant was made of Hetian white jade, carved into the shape of a lazy cat, which he had nurtured with his own demonic power when he first transformed into a human form. It could protect his mind and hide the demonic aura on his body. He rarely wore it on ordinary days, only bringing it out when entering the palace for banquets.

"Let's go." He said, turning and walking out of the courtyard.

The willow trees on both sides of the palace road had long sprouted new buds, with tender green branches hanging down, dancing gently in the wind. Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the branches, casting streaks of light on the ground. The palace eunuchs and maids passing by all bowed respectfully when they saw him, their expressions respectful but also carrying a hint of alienation. They all knew that this Ninth Prince was not favored, had no power or authority, just an idle prince with an empty title. There was no need to deliberately curry favor, nor to deliberately offend.

Zhu Changlan walked slowly, his steps leisurely, occasionally stopping to look at the flowers and grass by the roadside, or tease the birds on the branches. He saw a brightly feathered thrush perched on a branch, and stopped to say softly to the bird, "Little fellow, the weather is nice today, would you like to go to Consort Zheng's palace with me?"
His tone was soft and糯, with a hint of a smile.

The thrush seemed to understand his words, chirped a few times, and flapped its wings away. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan couldn't help laughing, his eyes full of gentle smiles. He was like this, carrying a hint of compassion and curiosity towards all things in the world, even stopping to "talk" to a small bird.

When passing a corner of the Imperial Garden, he smelled a familiar fragrance ------ the scent of osmanthus wine. His eyes suddenly lit up, like a cat that had found its prey, unconsciously twitching his nose, and his steps moved towards the direction of the fragrance. This osmanthus wine was his favorite. Every year when osmanthus flowers bloom, he would have someone pick fresh osmanthus, soak it in his own brewed rice wine, seal it in a pottery jar, and take it out in autumn and winter. The wine aroma mixed with osmanthus fragrance, mellow and sweet, not too strong, making him feel warm all over after drinking, the best for aiding sleep.

The pottery jars he used for brewing wine were also specially made, fired with clay from the foot of Kunlun Mountain, with good air permeability, allowing the osmanthus fragrance to better blend into the wine. When brewing, he would also add a few pieces of rock sugar and a slice of dried tangerine peel, saying this could make the taste more gentle and neutralize the cold nature of rice wine. The brewed osmanthus wine would be divided into small porcelain bottles, some for his own drinking, some given to the Crown Prince, and some rewarded to the palace eunuchs and maids around him.

Not far away, in a pavilion, several palace maids were dividing the osmanthus wine. In the transparent porcelain bottles, the golden wine liquid glowed with an attractive luster, and the rich osmanthus fragrance came rushing towards him, making him involuntarily swallow his saliva. He walked briskly over, with a gentle smile on his face, his tone soft and糯 like a coquettish child, making it impossible to refuse.

"This little sister, this osmanthus wine smells so fragrant, it must taste good. I wonder if I could have a taste?"

The palace maids were startled to meet the Ninth Prince here, and quickly bowed and saluted. "Greetings to His Highness the Ninth Prince."
The leading maid, who was slightly older, still maintained her composure, but her tone carried a hint of restraint.

"Rise."
Zhu Changlan waved his hand, his gaze still on the osmanthus wine, "I smell this osmanthus wine has a strong fragrance, it must taste good. I wonder if I could have a taste?"
His tone carried a hint of coquettish softness, making it really hard to refuse.

The leading maid hesitated for a moment and said, "Returning to Your Highness, this osmanthus wine was specially brewed by Consort Zheng for the banquet this afternoon. This slave dares not give it to Your Highness without permission."
Her tone carried a hint of difficulty, caught between Consort Zheng's rules and the prince's request, making it hard to choose.

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan's face showed a disappointed expression, his long eyelashes drooping, like a wronged cat, but then he smiled again, "It's okay, it was my impudence."
He didn't force it and turned to leave. Consort Zheng's things couldn't be touched, lest he bring unnecessary trouble upon himself.

Seeing this, the maid quickly said, "If Your Highness likes it, this slave has a small bottle hidden privately, which I brewed myself last year. If Your Highness doesn't mind, please take it."
With that, she took out a small white porcelain bottle from her sleeve and handed it over. This maid's name was Chuntao. Last year, she got lost in the Imperial Garden and accidentally entered the range of Xian'an Palace. She was stopped by Xiaoluzi, and it was Zhu Changlan who showed mercy, letting her drink a cup of hot tea before leaving. She had always remembered this kindness, and today seeing the prince liked the osmanthus wine, she wanted to give him her own hidden bottle.

Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up, and he quickly took the porcelain bottle, opened the lid to smell it. A rich osmanthus fragrance came rushing out, even purer than that in Consort Zheng's palace. "Thank you, little sister, I'll remember your kindness."
He smiled and said, carefully putting the porcelain bottle into his sleeve, not forgetting to remind her, "If you can't finish brewing good wine in the future, feel free to send it to Xian'an Palace. I'll reward you."

Chuntao quickly said, "Your Highness is too kind. It's my honor to serve Your Highness."
She smiled shyly, bowing to see Zhu Changlan off.

Zhu Changlan smiled and didn't say more, turning to continue towards Consort Zheng's Yikun Palace. Holding the small bottle of osmanthus wine in his hand, his mood improved a lot, and his steps became lighter. As he walked, he calculated in his mind that when he went back tonight, he would enjoy this osmanthus wine with a few small dishes ------ stir-fried peanuts, braised chicken feet, pickled cucumber, all his favorite side dishes, and have a good time.

He walked slowly, stopping and starting along the way, taking nearly half an hour for a journey that wasn't too far. When passing a lotus pond, he saw a little turtle lying on a rock by the pond, slowly sunbathing. He stopped and squatted down, quietly watching the little turtle for a full incense stick of time. The little turtle retracted its head, motionless, occasionally stretching out its claws to scratch its face, looking naive and cute. Zhu Changlan found it interesting, took out a peanut from his sleeve, peeled off the shell, and carefully placed it in front of the little turtle. The little turtle hesitated for a long time before slowly sticking out its head, picking up the peanut, and retracting again. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan couldn't help laughing, his eyes full of childlike innocence.

When passing near the imperial kitchen, he smelled the aroma of roasted chestnuts, which was rich with the caramelized fragrance of sugar roasting, making him involuntarily stop. He had always liked eating roasted chestnuts, especially in autumn and winter, warm roasted chestnuts in his arms were both warm and sweet. He asked Xiaoluzi to buy a bag, eating while walking. The chestnuts were sweet and soft, so sticky that some sugar froth stuck to the corner of his mouth. Xiaoluzi wanted to take out a brocade handkerchief to wipe his mouth, but he waved his hand, wiped it with his finger, and licked his fingertip casually, his actions natural, carrying a hint of unconscious feline nature.

When walking to a rockery, he saw several little palace maids huddled together, secretly exchanging embroidery items. They were embroidering small purses and fan covers with flower and bird patterns, their stitches were childish but full of vitality. Zhu Changlan walked over and said with a smile, "The things you embroidered are really beautiful. Can I take a look?"

The little palace maids were startled, quickly hiding their embroidery behind them and bowing to salute. "Greetings to His Highness the Ninth Prince."
They looked panicked, fearing being scolded by the prince.

Zhu Changlan smiled, "It's okay, I just think you embroidered well and want to take a look."
His tone was gentle, without the slightest hint of arrogance.

Upon seeing this, the little palace maids dared to take out their embroidery. Zhu Changlan picked up a purse embroidered with a cat and looked at it carefully, saying, "This cat is embroidered really vividly, especially these eyes, lively and lifelike."
He also pointed out a few things, "If you can embroider the cat's whiskers a little thinner, it will be more realistic. And for the fur color, using gradient silk thread will look better."

The little palace maids listened carefully, nodding in agreement. One of the bolder palace maids asked, "Does Your Highness also understand embroidery?"

Zhu Changlan smiled, "A little, I embroidered a few small things when I was bored."
He was telling the truth. Having lived for nearly a thousand years, he learned various skills in his free time, including embroidery, carpentry, tea art, calligraphy, and painting, all of which he was proficient in, but he never showed them in front of others.

He also told the little palace maids about several rare stitching methods, speaking clearly and thoroughly. The little palace maids listened with great interest, forgetting their fear and surrounding him to ask questions. Zhu Changlan was not annoyed, answering one by one until Xiaoluzi reminded him that it was getting late, and he smiled and said goodbye to the little palace maids, continuing towards Yikun Palace.

When he arrived at Yikun Palace, Eunuch Cui was already waiting outside the palace gate. Eunuch Cui was a favored person beside Consort Zheng, always arrogant, often neglecting princes who were not favored. At this moment, he wore a professional smile, his tone respectful, "His Highness the Ninth Prince, you're finally here. Consort Zheng has been waiting for you for a while."
There was a hint of urging in his tone.

Zhu Changlan smiled, patting the chestnut crumbs on his hands, "Sorry to keep you waiting, I encountered some interesting things on the way, which delayed some time."
His tone was relaxed, with a hint of a joke, cleverly defusing the dissatisfaction in Eunuch Cui's tone. When dealing with these eunuchs and maids, there's no need to be too serious. Occasionally feigning ignorance can avoid a lot of trouble.

Eunuch Cui couldn't say more, so he could only bow and say, "Please come inside, Your Highness."

Zhu Changlan followed Eunuch Cui into Yikun Palace. The interior was magnificent, with gold bricks paved on the ground, carved beams and painted rafters, every detail彰显着 Consort Zheng's noble status. Consort Zheng was sitting on the main seat, wearing a bright yellow palace dress, wearing a phoenix crown, her expression majestic, exuding an aura that strangers should not approach.

"My son pays respects to Mother Empress."
Zhu Changlan bowed and saluted, his tone respectful but also carrying a hint of alienation. He had never liked the aggressive aura on Consort Zheng, which reminded him of those competitive demons in the demon realm.

Consort Zheng raised her eyes, her gaze falling on him, with a hint of scrutiny, "Rise."
Her tone was flat, showing no joy or anger, but her eyes were like knives, scraping over him.

Zhu Changlan stood up, hanging his hands by his side, maintaining a respectful posture but always keeping a certain distance. He could feel the hostility from Consort Zheng, and could guess her purpose in finding him.

"I called you here today to give you an order."
Consort Zheng said slowly, "At the banquet this afternoon, the vassal envoys brought many rare treasures, as well as a master proficient in physiognomy, whom His Majesty values very much. You have always liked these metaphysical things, so go and chat with that master later, and let the envoys see that the princes of our Great Ming Wanli are not all wine bags and rice buckets."
Her tone carried a hint of command, as if it was natural for him to accompany the conversation.

Zhu Changlan understood in his heart that this was to let him go and support the scene, while also testing the background of that master of physiognomy. He smiled, his tone soft and糯, "My son will obey. But my little tricks are just to pass the time when I'm bored. If I make a fool of myself in front of the master and make the envoys laugh, that would be bad."
He deliberately showed weakness, reducing Consort Zheng's vigilance. Consort Zheng most disliked ambitious and capable people, especially those around the Crown Prince.

Consort Zheng frowned, seeming a little dissatisfied with his modesty, "You don't need to be too modest. His Majesty knows you like these things. If you can impress that master, it will be good for you."
Her tone carried a hint of temptation, as if as long as he obeyed, he could gain the emperor's favor.

Zhu Changlan sneered in his heart. If the emperor really valued him, he wouldn't let him live in this remote side hall of Xian'an Palace. Over the years, he had long seen through the royal family's coldness. But he still wore a gentle smile on his face, "My son understands, and will do his best not to disappoint Mother Empress and His Majesty."

Consort Zheng nodded in satisfaction, "It's good that you understand. Go prepare. The banquet starts at the third quarter of the tenth hour, don't be late."

"My son takes his leave." Zhu Changlan bowed and saluted, turning to leave Yikun Palace.

Walking out of Yikun Palace, the sunlight was still bright, but Zhu Changlan's mood was inexplicably heavy. The banquet this afternoon would not be simple. That master of physiognomy might use physiognomy as an excuse to spy on his background. Although his demonic aura was hidden well, it might not be able to escape the eyes of a true expert. And Consort Zheng certainly wanted to use this opportunity to see if he was really as idle and useless as he seemed on the surface.

He sighed softly, took out the small bottle of osmanthus wine from his sleeve, opened the lid, and took a small sip. The sweet wine liquid slid down his throat, carrying the fragrance of osmanthus, making his tense nerves relax a little. "Well, soldiers come to block, water comes to soil cover."
He murmured to himself, a hint of狡黠 flashing in his eyes. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, what storms hadn't he seen? This little scene couldn't defeat him. At worst, he would use his best skill of telling jokes to fool everything. After all, he was good at that.

He walked slowly back towards Xian'an Palace, still not forgetting to enjoy the scenery along the way. When passing a rockery, he smelled a faint fragrance of dried fish, and couldn't help stopping. His eyes suddenly lit up, like a cat smelling fish, unconsciously twitching his nose, following the scent.

Behind the rockery, a young eunuch was secretly eating dried fish, his face full of satisfaction. The young eunuch looked no more than fifteen or sixteen, with baby fat on his face, eating so happily that he didn't notice someone approaching. Zhu Changlan walked forward, patted his shoulder, and said with a smile, "This eunuch, you're in a good mood, eating dried fish here secretly."

The young eunuch was startled, the dried fish in his hand fell to the ground, and he quickly turned around. When he saw it was the Ninth Prince, his face instantly turned pale, "Your...
Your Highness, please spare me. This slave didn't mean it, it's just that I was too greedy, so..."
He was so scared that he stammered, kneeling on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly. The palace rules were strict, and eating privately was punishable, especially in such a place.

Zhu Changlan smiled, reached out to help him up, picked up the dried fish from the ground, patted off the dust, and smelled it, "This dried fish has a strong fragrance, it must taste good."
As he said this, he picked up a piece and took a gentle bite. The salty and crispy taste melted on his tongue, carrying the freshness of the sea, making him involuntarily squint his eyes. This dried fish had a familiar taste, very similar to the dried fish from the seaside fishing village at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, which was one of his favorite foods when he first opened his spiritual wisdom.

"Hmm, it does taste good."
He said with a smile, picking up another piece to slowly taste. He ate slowly, not like stealing, but like savoring some delicacy.

After eating a few pieces, he stopped, returning the remaining dried fish to the young eunuch, "Thank you for the dried fish, I ate very happily. If you want to eat in the future, eat openly, no need to hide."
His tone was gentle, with a hint of casualness, without the slightest air of a prince. "If the palace steward eunuch troubles you, just say I allowed you."

The young eunuch quickly bowed to thank him, "Thank you for Your Highness's grace, this slave... this slave will remember."
His voice carried a hint of sobbing, and his eyes turned red. He had been in the palace for three years, always being bullied, and this was the first time someone treated him so well.

Zhu Changlan smiled and didn't say more, turning to continue towards Xian'an Palace. The sunlight shone on him, stretching his shadow very long. His steps were still leisurely, still carrying a hint of laziness, but only he knew what a perceptive and tenacious heart was hidden under this seemingly idle exterior. He had seen the cruel battles of the demon realm, experienced the separation of life and death in the human world, and already understood that being gentle with others was not weakness, but a choice.

When he returned to Xian'an Palace, it was nearly noon. Xiaoluzi had already prepared lunch, four dishes and one soup, all light and delicious home-cooked dishes: stir-fried seasonal vegetables, white-cut chicken, steamed fish, and a bowl of winter melon and kelp soup, plus a pot of warm rice wine. These dishes were all Zhu Changlan's favorites, light and not greasy, most suitable for his appetite.

Zhu Changlan was always picky about food, but he didn't pay attention to delicacies from mountains and seas, only focusing on the freshness of ingredients and the lightness of cooking. He often said, "The way to health lies in lightness. Too greasy food can damage the spleen and stomach, which is not good for cultivation."
Therefore, the cooks in Xian'an Palace were best at making home-cooked dishes, cooking with less oil and salt, maximizing the original flavor of the ingredients.

The steamed fish was a crucian carp just fished from the imperial river that morning, with tender flesh. The cook only used ginger slices to remove the fishy smell, drizzled with a little light soy sauce and cooking wine, and steamed for a quarter of an hour. When eating, Zhu Changlan would drip a few drops of lemon juice, saying it could enhance the freshness and relieve greasiness. This lemon juice was specially brought from the Western Regions, usually stored in a sealed pottery jar, only taken out when eating fish.

The white-cut chicken was a free-range chicken raised in Xian'an Palace itself, with firm flesh. The cook cooked the chicken with just the right heat, then soaked it in ice water, making the chicken skin more elastic. The dipping sauce was made by Zhu Changlan himself, with garlic paste, ginger paste, green onions, plus a little light soy sauce and sesame oil, which was fragrant but not spicy.

He picked up the wine pot, poured himself a cup of rice wine, and took a small sip. The warm wine liquid slid down his throat, carrying a faint rice fragrance, making him feel warm all over. This rice wine was brewed in Xian'an Palace itself, with very low alcohol content and a sweet taste. He drank a cup every night to sleep peacefully. The rice used for brewing was glutinous rice tribute from the south, soaked for three hours before steaming, and a little osmanthus was added during fermentation, making the rice wine carry a faint osmanthus fragrance.

"Xiaoluzi, sit down and eat with me."
He said. Although the palace rules were strict, Xian'an Palace was remote, and not many people were watching, so there was no need to be too rigid.

Xiaoluzi quickly waved his hand, "My Prince, absolutely not. How dare this slave eat at the same table as Your Highness?"
Although he knew the prince was easygoing, he didn't dare to break the palace rules.

Zhu Changlan smiled, "It's okay, there's no one else here, no need to stick to those rules."
He never liked these complicated etiquette. In his opinion, all people should be equal. He picked up a piece of steamed fish and put it in Xiaoluzi's bowl, "Eat it, don't be polite. This fish was just fished this morning, very fresh."

Xiaoluzi hesitated for a moment, finally unable to refuse Zhu Changlan, carefully sat on a small stool beside him, picked up his chopsticks, and slowly ate. He ate very cautiously, only daring to pick the food in his own bowl, not daring to take the initiative to pick from the plate.

Seeing this, Zhu Changlan added a few more pieces of chicken to his bowl, "Eat more, you need to keep your energy up to accompany me to the banquet this afternoon."
He said while eating a piece of chicken himself.

The two chatted while eating. Xiaoluzi talked about some interesting things outside the palace, such as a new acrobatics troupe in the west of the city that could swallow swords and breathe fire; a storyteller in the south of the city who told "The Legend of Jianghu Heroes" very excitingly. Zhu Changlan listened with great interest, occasionally laughing. He had been away from the outside world for too long, and still yearned for it. He remembered his days of wandering the rivers and lakes, enjoying chivalry and freedom, unlike now, restricted everywhere.

He also remembered his time at the foot of Kunlun Mountain. At that time, he was still a carefree spirit cat, spending every day catching fish, practicing, and sunbathing. There was a clear lake at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, where the fish were tender. He often jumped into the lake to catch fish, and after eating, he would lie on the ancient tree by the lake to sunbathe, living a simple and pure life. Later, he accidentally ate an ancient spiritual fruit, opened his spiritual wisdom, and began his long cultivation journey.

After eating, Zhu Changlan returned to the reclining chair in the courtyard, sunbathing, drinking Lapsang Souchong tea, and holding a round fan, fanning gently. He closed his eyes, feeling the warmth of the sun, listening to the rustling of the wind through the leaves, and the sound of birds chirping in the distance, relaxing completely.

He also picked up the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" beside him and slowly flipped through it. He liked reading the descriptions of rare and exotic beasts in it, often imagining the appearance of those beasts based on the descriptions, and sometimes even drawing them. In the scrolls in his study, there were several paintings of exotic beasts from "Classic of Mountains and Seas" that he painted, with strange shapes and lifelike appearances.

After reading for a while, he felt a little sleepy, so he put down the book and closed his eyes again. His fingertips still curled up unconsciously, like a cat retracting its claws in a dream, with a faint smile on his lips. Perhaps in his dream, he returned to the foot of Kunlun Mountain, nestled beside an ancient tree, basking in the warm sun, with a group of like-minded companions around him.

Xiaoluzi stood guard beside him, watching the prince's sleeping figure, couldn't help shaking his head. This Ninth Prince was really a strange person. Clearly living in the deep palace, but able to live so perceptive and free, as if all the disputes in the world had nothing to do with him. The prince just didn't want to get involved in those disputes. He understood everything in his heart, but was too lazy to care. This was good. Being an idle prince, living in peace, was better than getting involved in those life-and-death struggles.

The sun gradually set in the west, and the sunlight became much softer. Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, stretched lazily, and yawned. He sat up, took a sip of warm tea, and his eyes became clear. "Xiaoluzi, prepare the carriage. It's time to go to the Imperial Garden for the banquet."
He said.

Xiaoluzi quickly responded, turning to prepare. Zhu Changlan stood up, adjusted his衣襟, picked up the round fan beside him, and fanned gently. He still wore a gentle smile on his face, still carrying a hint of laziness, but his eyes hid a hint of vigilance that was hard to detect.

This banquet was definitely not going to be peaceful. But he wasn't afraid, because he was Xuan Yu True Man, a nine-tailed cat demon who had lived for nearly a thousand years, and also the Ninth Prince of the Great Ming Wanli. No matter what situation he encountered, he could handle it calmly.

He walked out of Xian'an Palace and got into the carriage. The carriage slowly moved towards the Imperial Garden. Outside the window, the setting sun dyed the sky into a brilliant orange-red. Zhu Changlan looked at the scenery outside the window, the corner of his mouth slightly raised, revealing a confident and calm smile.

This game was just beginning. And he would be the final winner.
