# Chapter 1: The "Idle Noble" Daily Life of the Ninth Prince

Spring of the 25th year of the Wanli era in the Great Ming Dynasty, with clear skies and gentle winds.

The side hall of Tranquility Peace Palace, located in the western part of the Forbidden City's inner court, was always the quietest place in the entire palace. This palace was originally the residence of a consort dowager from the previous dynasty. After Zhu Changlan was adopted by the Empress, the Emperor ordered it to be renovated specially as his residence. The main hall of Tranquility Peace Palace hung the plaque "Ci An" (慈安, meaning "Compassionate Peace"), written by the Empress herself. The interior furnishings were simple and elegant, mostly consisting of scholarly treasures and paintings by famous artists from the Jiangnan region, reflecting the Empress's love and expectations for him. Unlike the bustling Eastern Palace or the noisy Upheld Majesty Palace, even the eunuchs and palace maids passing by on the palace roads moved with extremely light steps, as if afraid to disturb the master of this side hall
------ the current Ninth Prince, Zhu Changlan.

Oh, that's not quite right. The palace people privately called him the "Ninth Prince," but he preferred others to call him
"Immortal Meta Jade," or more affectionately
"Xiao Jiu" (Little Nine). However, in this palace, there were very few people left who dared to call him that.

It was approaching the third hour of the morning (9:00-11:00 AM). The sun had risen above the palace walls, filtering through the carved window lattice and casting dappled light on the blue brick floor. In the courtyard of the side hall, several old osmanthus trees had just sprouted new shoots, their tender green leaves gently swaying in the breeze, filling the air with a faint scent of fresh vegetation. A few clusters of orchids were planted at the base of the wall, their leaves lush and green. Zhu Changlan had transplanted them himself, saying they were taken from the spiritual valley at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, carrying a natural elegance that allowed them to thrive even in the deep palace. In the center of the courtyard, his beloved pear wood recliner was crafted from the finest old pear wood, which had been air-dried for three years before being meticulously carved by the best carpenter in the capital according to his design. The armrests were carved with intertwined lotus patterns, with smooth lines and fully opened petals. When you got close, you could smell the warm fragrance of the wood itself, mixed with the scent of vegetation from the courtyard, making people feel inexplicably peaceful.

Zhu Changlan was reclining on the chair, sound asleep. He was covered with a plain silk thin blanket, embroidered with dark gold intertwined lotus patterns---one of his few favorite elaborate decorations. After all, who could resist golden things? The warm sunlight shone on him, outlining his elegant facial features. At twenty years old, in the prime of his youth, he was extremely handsome. His eyebrows were like distant mountains, his eyes like autumn water, with a high nose bridge and clear lip lines. His skin was fair, having rarely been exposed to strong sunlight. Those eyes were now gently closed, his long, dense eyelashes casting a small shadow under his eyelids, adding a touch of laziness and casualness.

His sleep was restless. Sometimes he would softly smack his lips, sometimes his brows would furrow slightly. His fingertips would curl unconsciously and then slowly spread out, with his knuckles turning slightly white, like a cat retracting and extending its claws in a dream, with a touch of unconscious charm. This was a habit he had since childhood. Even after being reborn as a human for so many years, the cat nature in his bones had never faded. Sometimes when he slept deeply, he would unconsciously let out an extremely soft purring sound, as faint as a mosquito's hum, which, paired with his handsome face, created a striking contrast. Occasionally, he would tilt his head slightly, his cheek rubbing against the soft pillow, just like a cat nuzzling its owner's palm to show affection.

"Meow～"

An extremely soft cat meow escaped from his throat, almost blending with the birdsong outside the courtyard. Little Salary, the eunuch guarding nearby, was already accustomed to this. He just softened his steps, adding some calming sandalwood to the incense burner. This sandalwood was specially obtained by Zhu Changlan from the Western Regions. It was hard in texture and had a mellow fragrance. When lit, the smoke column was straight, neither dispersing nor extinguishing, capable of calming the mind and settling the qi. Little Salary had also specially placed a small dish of clear water beside the incense burner, saying it would make the sandalwood fragrance more gentle. This method was taught by Zhu Changlan himself, claiming that "mystical cultivation focuses on the details."

Little Salary had been with Zhu Changlan since entering the palace, counting five years now. He was originally a child from a farming family on the outskirts of Beijing. His parents died early, and he was sent to Tranquility Peace Palace to serve. Due to his steady and careful nature, as well as being neither greedy nor talkative, he gradually became the most capable person by Zhu Changlan's side. This Ninth Prince seemed indifferent and idle, having no interest in worldly affairs, but in reality, he was perceptive and extremely intelligent. He saw through all the open and hidden struggles in the imperial court and the palace intrigues better than anyone, but he just couldn't be bothered to get involved. After all, his biological mother died early, leaving him without a backer, and the Emperor paid him no attention. In this deep palace, only by pretending to be an "ignorant, pleasure-seeking" idle noble could he avoid those whirlpools and live in peace.

Take the layout of Tranquility Peace Palace, for example. Everywhere reflected the Prince's "idleness." On the bookshelf in his study, half were books of poetry, calligraphy, and painting, while the other half were esoteric works like *Classic of Mountains and Seas* and *Baopuzi*, along with some miscellaneous books on carpentry and tea art. On the desk was a wooden pen holder he made himself, shaped like a curled-up cat, lifelike. In the brush holder were several writing brushes with rounded tips, but they were ordinary goat hair brushes, not rare treasures custom-made by famous artists. On the couch was a soft pillow embroidered with a napping cat, which he had asked the embroidery maid of Tranquility Peace Palace to make, saying that sleeping on it would allow him to dream of his hometown at the foot of Kunlun Mountain.

"Your Highness, it's time to wake up. If you sleep any longer, you might miss the midday meal."

Little Salary called softly, his voice so low it was like he was afraid to startle the birds on the branches. In his hand, he held a bowl of warm refreshing soup, brewed with licorice, dried tangerine peel, and lotus seeds. It wasn't bitter or astringent, with a faint sweetness, perfect for waking someone from sleep. This recipe was also created by Zhu Changlan himself, claiming that spring has heavy dampness, and drinking this can invigorate the spleen and dispel dampness without damaging the spleen and stomach.

Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, his eyes still hazy with just-woken confusion, his gaze sleepy and slightly moist. He stretched lazily, his movements stretching out, his shoulder blades gently opening and closing, just like a cat that had sunbathed enough in the afternoon, exuding a relaxed energy all over. "Hmm......
Such fine sunlight, it would be a waste not to sleep."
His tone was soft, with a hoarse voice from just waking up, his tone rising slightly at the end, naturally carrying a three-point smile that warmed people's hearts.

He sat up, and the thin blanket slipped from his body, revealing an undergarment of moon-white brocade. The collar and cuffs were embroidered with fine silver cloud patterns, with dense stitches. It was made by the embroidery maid of Tranquility Peace Palace according to his request---not too ostentatious, but also not losing the dignity of a prince. Little Salary quickly stepped forward, offering the refreshing soup, and picked up a jade comb from the side, gently combing his slightly messy long hair. Zhu Changlan let him tend to him, his gaze falling on the newly sprouted osmanthus tree in the courtyard, asking in a flat tone: "Any news in the palace today?"

There was no trace of curiosity in his voice, as if it was just casual chatter.

While combing, Little Salary replied: "Reporting to Your Highness, this morning, Crown Prince from the Eastern Palace sent someone to bring some newly made pastries. They said they were osmanthus cakes from the Jiangnan tribute, and knowing you like them, they specially saved a portion for you. Also, this afternoon, the Emperor will hold a banquet in the Imperial Garden to entertain several envoys from vassal states, and all palace princes are invited to accompany."
He paused, then added: "The person sent by the Crown Prince also said that if you're too lazy to attend the banquet, he will cover for you in front of the Emperor, saying you've caught a slight cold."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan raised an eyebrow, a flash of imperceptible warmth in his eyes, which quickly returned to calm. "The Crown Prince is thoughtful."
He spoke softly, his fingertips unconsciously caressing the wooden armrest of the recliner. In this cold imperial palace, Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was the only one who treated him sincerely. When he first entered the palace after being reborn, he was still young. His biological mother, Zhang Youxuan, was poisoned to death early by Consort Zheng colluding with the Black Bone Sect. Zhang Youxuan was originally a palace maid during the Wanli era, from a family of Taoist practitioners, with deep ties to Azure Cloud Temple. She was envied by Consort Zheng for her cultivation talent and was ultimately killed. Her early death left the Emperor indifferent to him, and the palace eunuchs and maids also acted according to the wind, often neglecting him. Once, he was secretly wiping tears in a corner of the Imperial Garden, missing the scent of vegetation at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, when he was discovered by the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince didn't ask any questions, just silently sat with him, and even gave him his favorite wooden rattle, saying: "Ninth Brother, I will protect you from now on."
He remembered this kindness for three hundred years, never forgetting it even after reincarnation.

The Crown Prince knew he liked wooden things. Last year, he specially gave him a set of red sandalwood tea set, hard in texture and with delicate grain. Zhu Changlan cherished it greatly, only taking it out on important days. This time, the osmanthus cakes sent were also his favorite. The Crown Prince always remembered his preferences clearly.

As for the banquet in the Imperial Garden, he originally didn't want to go. That kind of occasion was nothing more than the Emperor showing his authority, officials flattering each other, and vassal envoys being polite. It was really meaningless. Moreover, he was never good at socializing and couldn't be bothered to look at those people's hypocritical faces. But on second thought, the Crown Prince's power in the court had gradually grown, already attracting the jealousy of Consort Zheng and several princes. If he openly absented himself, it might bring criticism to the Crown Prince for "indulging his brother and disregarding the Emperor's orders."

"Understood. Have the carriage prepared when the time comes."

He said lightly, with a touch of resignation in his tone. After all, it was an imperial order. Although he wasn't favored, he couldn't openly defy it, and he didn't want to cause trouble for the Crown Prince.

Little Salary responded, adding: "Your Highness, the osmanthus cakes are still warm in the side hall. Would you like to try them now?"

Zhu Changlan nodded, "Very well."
He really liked osmanthus cakes, especially those from the Jiangnan tribute. They were made with newly picked golden osmanthus and the finest soft white sugar, sweet but not cloying, with a faint osmanthus fragrance. Paired with Lapsang Souchong tea, it was perfect.

Soon, Little Salary brought in a plate of osmanthus cakes. The pastries were neatly arranged on a pear wood tray, golden in color, with dried osmanthus flowers decorating the edges, emitting a rich fragrance of osmanthus and rice. Zhu Changlan picked up one, took a small bite. The soft and sweet texture melted on his tongue, with the fragrance of osmanthus lingering in his nose, making him narrow his eyes in satisfaction. "Hmm, only the Crown Prince understands me."
He smiled, picking up another piece and savoring it slowly. After eating two pieces, he felt a bit greasy. Little Salary timely handed him a cup of freshly brewed Lapsang Souchong tea.

Zhu Changlan took the tea cup. His fingertips touched the warm purple clay cup wall, and his heart felt warm. This teacup was an old purple clay piece he had specially found. It had excellent breathability, which could maximize the mellow fragrance of Lapsang Souchong. He had always loved drinking Lapsang Souchong, not too fond of overly light green tea or overly strong Pu'er, only preferring the mellow sweetness of Lapsang Souchong. It was said that this tea was carefully roasted by tea farmers at the foot of Wuyi Mountain, with a unique pine smoke fragrance. He fell in love with it at first sip, and specially had a small tea garden opened in the backyard of Tranquility Peace Palace. Although it couldn't replicate the flavor of Wuyi Mountain tea, it could at least satisfy his cravings.

The water used for making tea was also particular. He had Little Salary fetch the first bucket of water from the ancient well in the Imperial Garden every morning, claiming that "morning dew merges with well water, and the water quality is clear, best for bringing out the tea fragrance." When brewing, the water temperature should be just boiling, not too hot or too cold. The water should be poured slowly along the edge of the tea cup, not directly onto the tea leaves, saying that this allows the tea fragrance to release slowly.

While enjoying the tea and pastries, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from outside the courtyard, accompanied by the soft voices of palace maids. Zhu Changlan looked up and saw a palace maid in light green palace clothes, cautiously peering inside, her expression somewhat reserved.

"What's the matter?"
Little Salary stepped forward, blocking the palace maid's view, and asked in a deep voice.

The palace maid quickly bowed, "Reporting to Ninth Prince, reporting to Eunuch Little Salary. It's Eunuch Cui from Consort Zheng's palace. He says Consort Zheng has invited Ninth Prince over for an important discussion."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan's movements paused, a flash of confusion in his eyes. Consort Zheng had never had much to do with him. In fact, because he was close to the Crown Prince, she often made sarcastic remarks about him, seeing him as a "idle follower" by the Crown Prince's side. Why would she suddenly invite him over today? He put down the osmanthus cake, wiped his mouth with a brocade handkerchief, and said slowly: "Understood. This Prince will go later."
He remained calm, his tone still flat, as if it was just an ordinary invitation.

The palace maid replied, bowing and retreating, her steps hurried as if she was afraid to stay a second longer.

Little Salary looked at Zhu Changlan worriedly, "Your Highness, Consort Zheng suddenly wants to see you. I'm afraid it's no good. I heard a few days ago that people from Consort Zheng's palace were inquiring about your whereabouts and who you usually interact with."

Zhu Changlan smiled, patting Little Salary on the shoulder, "Don't worry. Soldiers come and block, water comes and earth covers. Could she possibly eat this Prince?"
His tone was relaxed, with a hint of playfulness, but there was an imperceptible sharp edge hidden in his eyes. Having lived in this deep palace for so many years, he had long learned to use jokes to defuse tense situations, and also learned to hide his sharpness under a gentle appearance. Having lived for nearly a thousand years, what kind of schemes had he not seen? Consort Zheng's little tricks were merely child's play in his eyes.

He picked up a folding fan from the side and began fanning himself gently. This folding fan also had wooden ribs, made of tough chicken-wing wood. The fan surface was painted with ink landscapes, drawn by himself. The distant mountains were like ink, the nearby water held mist, and there was a lazy cat lying on a rock sunbathing --- exactly the free and easy life he yearned for. The inscription "Meta Jade" on the fan surface had elegant brushwork, with a touch of casualness. In his free time, he liked to paint and write, not to gain fame, but for his own entertainment. On the walls of his study hung several of his paintings, all of landscapes, flowers, birds, and a few sketches of cats, each with different forms, lifelike.

"Little Salary, help this Prince change clothes." he said.

Little Salary quickly responded, turning to fetch clothes. Zhu Changlan stood up, stretching his body, and habitually curled his fingertips, feeling the warmth of the sun. Consort Zheng wanting to see him was most likely because of the banquet this afternoon. That "master of divination" brought by the vassal envoy was probably not simple. Consort Zheng had always feared the Crown Prince. Perhaps she wanted to use this master's hand to either test his true identity or create trouble for the Crown Prince.

However, he had always been lazy to get involved in these palace and court disputes. He just wanted to be his idle noble peacefully --- drinking tea, reading books, sunbathing, drinking a cup of rice wine at night, falling asleep to the sound of insects, and occasionally chatting with the Crown Prince. Such days were his idea of perfection. But in this deep palace, there was never true peace. "The tree desires calm, but the wind will not cease." Some things weren't meant to be avoided.

Soon, Little Salary brought a stone-blue brocade robe. This robe was made of Jiangnan tribute brocade, soft in texture and calm in color. The collar was embroidered with a circle of dark gold cloud patterns, neither losing the dignity of a prince nor being too ostentatious. Zhu Changlan put on the clothes, adjusting his lapels in front of a bronze mirror. In the mirror, the man had a handsome face and a gentle temperament, but there was a touch of detached and lazy wisdom in his eyes that saw through the world. Facing the mirror, he unconsciously learned a cat meow, "Meow～", the sound soft and sweet, completely out of place with his current attire, making him laugh at himself.

He also specially took out a jade pendant, tying it around his waist. This jade pendant was made of Hetian white jade, carved into the shape of a cat with a lazy expression. He had nurtured it with his demonic power when he first transformed into a human. It could protect his mind and hide the demonic aura on his body. He rarely wore it normally, only taking it out for palace banquets.

"Let's go." he said, turning to walk out of the courtyard.

The willow trees along the palace road had already sprouted new shoots. The tender green branches hung down, dancing with the wind. Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the leaves, casting strips of light on the ground. The palace eunuchs and maids who passed by all bowed in greeting, their expressions respectful but also somewhat distant. They all knew that this Ninth Prince was not favored, without power or influence, just an idle prince with an empty title. There was no need to deliberately curry favor, nor to deliberately offend.

Zhu Changlan walked slowly, his steps leisurely, occasionally stopping to look at the flowers and plants by the roadside, or to tease the birds on the branches. He saw a brightly feathered thrush perched on a branch. He stopped and spoke softly to the bird: "Little guy, the weather is so nice today. Why don't you come with this Prince to Consort Zheng's palace?"

His tone was soft and sweet, with a hint of a smile.

The thrush seemed to understand his words, chirping a few times before flapping its wings and flying away. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan couldn't help but laugh, his eyes full of gentle smiles. This was how he was, always somewhat compassionate and curious towards all living things in the world, even a small bird would make him stop to "converse" with it.

Passing by a corner of the Imperial Garden, he smelled a familiar scent ------ that of osmanthus wine. His eyes lit up instantly, like a cat who had found its prey. He unconsciously twitched his nose, his steps moving towards the direction of the scent. This osmanthus wine was his favorite. Every year when the osmanthus blooms, he would have people pick fresh osmanthus flowers, soak them in his own brewed rice wine, and seal them in clay jars. When autumn and winter come, he would take them out. The wine aroma mixed with the osmanthus fragrance, mellow and sweet, with low alcohol content. Drinking it makes the whole body warm, perfect for aiding sleep.

The clay jars he used for brewing were specially made from pottery clay from the foot of Kunlun Mountain, with good breathability, allowing the osmanthus fragrance to better blend into the wine. When brewing, he also added a few pieces of rock sugar and a slice of dried tangerine peel, claiming that it makes the taste more gentle and can neutralize the coldness of the rice wine. The brewed osmanthus wine would be divided into small porcelain bottles. Some he kept for himself to drink, some he gave to the Crown Prince, and some he rewarded to the eunuchs and maids around him.

Not far away, in a pavilion, several palace maids were bottling osmanthus wine. In the transparent porcelain bottles, the golden wine liquid shimmered with alluring radiance, and a rich osmanthus fragrance rushed towards him, making him swallow involuntarily. He walked over briskly, a gentle smile on his face, his voice soft and sweet: "Miss, could I have a cup of this osmanthus wine to taste?"

The palace maids didn't expect to meet the Ninth Prince here, and they all jumped in surprise, quickly bowing in greeting. "Greetings, Ninth Prince."
The lead maid was slightly older, still maintaining composure, but her tone was somewhat reserved.

"Rise."
Zhu Changlan waved his hand, his gaze still fixed on the osmanthus wine. "This Prince smells this osmanthus wine has a very strong fragrance, so it must taste good. I wonder if I could beg for a cup to taste?"
His tone was somewhat coquettish and sweet, making it impossible to refuse.

The lead maid hesitated for a moment, saying: "Reporting to Your Highness, this osmanthus wine was specially brewed by Consort Zheng's order, saying it's for this afternoon's banquet. This servant dares not give it to Your Highness privately."
Her tone was somewhat difficult. On one hand, there was Consort Zheng's rules, and on the other hand, there was the Prince's request. It was really hard to choose.

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan's face showed a disappointed expression. His long eyelashes drooped slightly, like a wronged cat. But then he smiled again, "No problem. It was this Prince who was presumptuous."
He didn't press further, turning to leave. Consort Zheng's things should not be messed with, to avoid unnecessary trouble for himself.

Seeing this, the maid quickly said: "If Your Highness likes it, this servant has a small bottle privately kept from last year's brewing. If Your Highness doesn't mind, you can take it."
As she spoke, she took out a small white porcelain bottle from her sleeve and handed it over. This maid's name was Chuntao. Last year, she got lost in the Imperial Garden and accidentally wandered into the area of Tranquility Peace Palace. She was stopped by Little Salary. It was Zhu Changlan who showed mercy and even let her drink a cup of hot tea before leaving. She had always remembered this kindness. Today, seeing the Prince liked osmanthus wine, she thought of taking out her own private stash.

Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up. He quickly took the porcelain bottle, opened the lid, and sniffed it. A rich osmanthus fragrance rushed towards him, even purer than that in Consort Zheng's palace. "Thank you, Miss. This Prince remembers your kindness."
He smiled, carefully putting the porcelain bottle into his sleeve, not forgetting to instruct, "If you have leftover good wine in the future, you can bring it to Tranquility Peace Palace. This Prince will reward you."

Chuntao quickly said: "Your Highness is too kind. Being able to serve Your Highness is this servant's fortune."
She smiled shyly, bowing to see Zhu Changlan off.

Zhu Changlan smiled, not saying more, turning to continue towards Consort Zheng's Upheld Majesty Palace. Holding the bottle of osmanthus wine in his hand, his mood improved a lot, and his steps became lighter. As he walked, he planned in his mind that when he returned at night, he would enjoy this osmanthus wine with a few side dishes ------ stir-fried peanuts, braised chicken feet, pickled cucumbers, all his favorite drinking dishes.

Walking and stopping along the way, he took nearly half an hour for a journey that wasn't too far. Passing by a lotus pond, he saw a small turtle lying on a rock by the pond, slowly sunbathing. He stopped and squatted down, quietly watching the turtle for a full incense stick's time. The turtle retracted its head, motionless, occasionally extending its claws to scratch its face, looking naive and cute. Zhu Changlan found it amusing. He took a peanut from his sleeve, peeled off the shell, and carefully placed it in front of the turtle. The turtle hesitated for a long time before slowly extending its head, picking up the peanut, and then retracting again. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan couldn't help but laugh out loud, his eyes full of childlike innocence.

Passing near the Imperial Kitchen, he smelled the aroma of roasted chestnuts. The rich aroma,带着 the charred sweetness of sugar, made him stop. He had always liked eating roasted chestnuts, especially in autumn and winter. Holding warm roasted chestnuts in his arms was warm and sweet. He asked Little Salary to buy a pack, eating them as he walked. The chestnuts were sweet and soft, making the corners of his mouth sticky with sugar. Little Salary wanted to take out a brocade handkerchief to wipe his mouth, but he waved it away, wiping his mouth with his fingers and casually licking the tips of his fingers. His actions were natural,带着几分不自知的猫性.

Walking to a rockery, he saw several young palace maids huddled together, secretly exchanging embroidery. They were embroidering small purses and fan covers, with birds, flowers, fish, and insects on them. The stitching was childish but full of vitality. Zhu Changlan walked over, smiling and saying: "Your embroidery is really beautiful. Can I take a look?"

The young palace maids were startled, quickly hiding their embroidery behind their backs and bowing in greeting. "Greetings, Ninth Prince."
They looked panicked, afraid of being scolded by the Prince.

Zhu Changlan smiled, "It's okay. I just think you embroider well and want to see."
His tone was gentle, without any arrogance.

Only then did the young palace maids dare to take out their embroidery. Zhu Changlan picked up a purse embroidered with a cat, examining it carefully, saying: "This cat is embroidered very vividly, especially the eyes, which seem to come alive."
He also gave some pointers, "If you embroider the cat's whiskers a bit finer, it will be more realistic. Also, for the fur color, using gradient silk thread would look better."

The young palace maids listened attentively, nodding in agreement. One of the bolder maids asked: "Does Your Highness also understand embroidery?"

Zhu Changlan smiled, "A little. When I'm free, I've embroidered a few small things."
He was telling the truth. Having lived for nearly a thousand years, he had learned various skills in his spare time --- embroidery, carpentry, tea art, calligraphy and painting --- all without exception. He just never showed them in front of people.

He also told the young palace maids about several rare stitching methods, speaking clearly and coherently. The young palace maids listened with great interest, forgetting their fear, surrounding him with questions. Zhu Changlan was not annoyed, answering each question until Little Salary reminded him that time was limited. Only then did he smile and bid farewell to the young palace maids, continuing towards Upheld Majesty Palace.

Upon arriving at Upheld Majesty Palace, Eunuch Cui was already waiting at the palace gate. Eunuch Cui was a favorite of Consort Zheng. He had always been arrogant and often looked down on unfavored princes. At this moment, he wore a professional smile on his face, his tone respectful but somewhat urgent: "Ninth Prince, you're finally here. Consort Zheng has been waiting for you for a while."

Zhu Changlan smiled, patting the chestnut crumbs from his hands, "I'm sorry to have kept Eunuch Cui waiting. I encountered some interesting things on the way, which delayed me."
His tone was relaxed, with a hint of playfulness, skillfully diffusing the dissatisfaction in Eunuch Cui's tone. When dealing with these eunuchs and palace maids, there's no need to be too serious. Sometimes feigning ignorance can avoid more trouble.

Eunuch Cui didn't know what else to say, so he could only bow and say: "Please come inside, Your Highness."

Zhu Changlan followed Eunuch Cui into Upheld Majesty Palace. The interior was decorated luxuriously, with golden bricks on the floor, carved beams and painted pillars, everywhere showing Consort Zheng's noble status. Consort Zheng was sitting on the main seat, wearing a bright yellow palace dress, a phoenix crown on her head, her expression authoritative, exuding an aura that strangers should not approach.

"Your servant pays respects to the Empress Dowager."
Zhu Changlan bowed, his tone respectful but also somewhat distant. He had never liked the hostility on Consort Zheng, which reminded him of those aggressive monsters in the demon world.

Consort Zheng raised her eyes, her gaze falling on him, somewhat scrutinizing, "Rise."
Her tone was flat, without joy or anger, but her eyes were like knives, scraping over him.

Zhu Changlan stood up, hands hanging down, his posture respectful but always maintaining a certain distance. He could feel Consort Zheng's hostility, and could also guess her purpose for finding him.

"The reason I called you here today is to give you an order."
Consort Zheng said slowly, "At this afternoon's banquet, the vassal envoys brought many rare treasures, as well as a master of divination whom the Emperor values highly. You've always liked these mystical arts. At that time, you can chat with that master, so that the envoys can see that the princes of our Great Ming Wanli era are not all wine bags and rice sacks."
Her tone was somewhat commanding, as if it was only natural for him to accompany the chat.

Zhu Changlan understood in his heart. It turned out she wanted him to hold up the scene and also test the true identity of that divination master. He smiled, his tone soft and sweet: "Your servant obeys. But Your servant's trivial skills are just a way to pass the time. If I make a fool of myself in front of the master and make the envoys laugh, that wouldn't be good."
He deliberately showed weakness, lowering Consort Zheng's guard. What Consort Zheng disliked most were ambitious and capable people, especially those around the Crown Prince.

Consort Zheng frowned, seemingly dissatisfied with his modesty, "You don't have to belittle yourself. The Emperor knows you like these things. If you can impress that master, it will be good for you."
Her tone was somewhat tempting, as if as long as he was obedient, he could win the Emperor's favor.

Zhu Changlan sneered inwardly. If the Emperor really valued him, he wouldn't let him live in this remote side hall of Tranquility Peace Palace. Over the years, he had long seen through the royal family's coldness and ruthlessness. But on the surface, he still wore a gentle smile, "Your servant understands. I will do my best not to disappoint Your Majesty and the Emperor."

Consort Zheng nodded in satisfaction, "You understand. Go prepare. The banquet begins at the third quarter of the fourth hour. Don't be late."

"Your servant takes leave." Zhu Changlan bowed, turning to exit Upheld Majesty Palace.

Walking out of Upheld Majesty Palace, the sun was still bright, but Zhu Changlan's mood was inexplicably heavy. This afternoon's banquet would definitely not be simple. That master of divination might use divination to spy on his true identity. Although his demonic aura was hidden well, it might not be able to hide from a true expert. And Consort Zheng definitely wanted to use this opportunity to see if he was really as idle and useless as he appeared on the surface.

He let out a soft sigh, taking out the bottle of osmanthus wine from his sleeve, opening the lid and taking a small sip. The sweet wine slid down his throat, carrying the fragrance of osmanthus, slightly relaxing his tense nerves. "Oh well, soldiers come and block, water comes and earth covers."
He murmured to himself, a cunning light flashing in his eyes. Having lived for nearly a thousand years, what storms had he not seen? This small scene was not difficult for him. At worst, he would use his most skilled jokes to muddle through everything.

He walked slowly back towards Tranquility Peace Palace, still not forgetting to enjoy the scenery along the way. Passing by a rockery, he smelled a faint scent of dried fish, and couldn't help but stop. His eyes lit up instantly, like a cat smelling fish, unconsciously twitching his nose, following the scent.

Behind the rockery, a young eunuch was secretly eating dried fish, his face full of satisfaction. This eunuch looked no more than fifteen or sixteen years old, with baby fat on his face. He was eating happily, completely unaware of someone approaching. Zhu Changlan walked forward, patting him on the shoulder, smiling and saying: "Eunuch, you're in a good mood, eating dried fish here secretly."

The young eunuch was startled, the dried fish in his hand falling to the ground. He quickly turned around. Seeing it was the Ninth Prince, his face instantly turned pale, "Y...
Your Highness, please spare me. This servant didn't do it on purpose. I was just too greedy, so I..."
He was so scared that he stammered, thudding to his knees and kowtowing repeatedly. The palace rules were strict. Eating privately was a punishment, let alone eating in such a place.

Zhu Changlan smiled, reaching out to help him up, picking up the dried fish from the ground, patting off the dust, and sniffing it, "This dried fish has a rich fragrance. It must taste good."
As he spoke, he picked up a piece and took a small bite. The salty and crispy texture melted on his tongue, carrying the freshness of the sea, making him narrow his eyes. This dried fish was a familiar taste, very similar to the dried fish from the fishing village at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, which was one of his favorite foods when he first gained intelligence.

"Hmm, it does taste good."
He smiled, picking up another piece and savoring it slowly. He ate slowly, not like someone stealing food, but like someone savoring a rare delicacy.

The young eunuch was stunned, not expecting that the Ninth Prince would not only not punish him, but also eat his dried fish. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but didn't know what to say.

After eating a few pieces, Zhu Changlan stopped, returning the remaining dried fish to the young eunuch, "Thank you, Eunuch, for the dried fish. This Prince ate very happily. If you want to eat in the future, you can eat openly. There's no need to be sneaky."
His tone was gentle, somewhat casual, without any royal arrogance. "If the steward eunuchs trouble you, just say it's this Prince who let you eat."

The young eunuch quickly bowed in thanks, "Thank you for Your Highness's grace. This servant... this servant remembers."
His voice was somewhat choked with emotion, and his eyes were red. He had been in the palace for three years, always being bullied. This was the first time someone had been so kind to him.

Zhu Changlan smiled, not saying more, turning to continue towards Tranquility Peace Palace. The sunlight shone on him, stretching his shadow very long. His steps were still leisurely, still somewhat lazy, but only he knew how transparent and resilient his heart was. He had seen the cruel battles in the demon world, experienced the separation of life and death in the human world, and had long understood that treating people with kindness was not weakness, but a choice.

When he returned to Tranquility Peace Palace, it was nearly noon. Little Salary had already prepared the midday meal: four dishes and one soup, all light and delicious home-cooked dishes: stir-fried seasonal vegetables, white-cut chicken, steamed fish, and a bowl of winter melon and kelp soup, plus a pot of warm rice wine. These dishes were all Zhu Changlan's favorites, light and not greasy, most suitable for his taste.

Zhu Changlan was always picky about food, but he didn't care about rare delicacies, only emphasizing fresh ingredients and light cooking. He often said: "The way to health lies in lightness. Too greasy food damages the spleen and stomach, which is not good for cultivation."
Therefore, the cook in Tranquility Peace Palace was best at home-cooked dishes, using less oil and salt during cooking to maximize the original flavor of the ingredients.

The steamed fish was a crucian carp freshly caught from the Imperial River that morning. The cook simply used ginger slices to remove the fishy smell, poured a little light soy sauce and cooking wine, and steamed it for a quarter of an hour. When Zhu Changlan ate it, he would also add a few drops of lemon juice, claiming that it could enhance the freshness and also cut the grease. This lemon juice was brought from the Western Regions, usually stored in a sealed clay jar, only taken out when eating fish.

The white-cut chicken was a free-range chicken raised by Tranquility Peace Palace itself, with firm meat. The cook controlled the heat just right when boiling the chicken. After boiling, it was quickly cooled with ice water, making the chicken meat more elastic. The dipping sauce was prepared by Zhu Changlan himself, using garlic paste, ginger paste, chopped green onions, plus a little light soy sauce and sesame oil. It was fresh and fragrant, but not spicy.

He picked up the wine pot, pouring himself a cup of rice wine, taking a small sip. The warm wine slid down his throat,带着 a faint rice fragrance, making his whole body feel warm. This rice wine was brewed by Tranquility Peace Palace itself, with a very low alcohol content and a sweet taste. He would drink a cup every night to sleep peacefully. The rice used for brewing was glutinous rice from Jiangnan tribute, which was soaked for three hours before being steamed. A little osmanthus was also added during fermentation, giving the rice wine a faint osmanthus fragrance.

"Little Salary, sit down and eat with me." he said. Although the palace rules were strict, Tranquility Peace Palace was remote, with few people watching, so there was no need to be too rigid.

Little Salary quickly waved his hands, "Your Highness, absolutely not. How dare this servant eat at the same table as Your Highness?"
Although he knew the Prince was easy-going, he didn't dare to break the palace rules.

Zhu Changlan smiled, "It's okay. There are no outsiders here, so you don't need to be rigid about these rules."
He had never liked these cumbersome formalities. In his view, all people should be equal. He picked up a piece of steamed fish and put it in Little Salary's bowl, "Eat. Don't be polite. This fish was freshly caught this morning, very fresh."

Little Salary hesitated for a moment, ultimately unable to resist Zhu Changlan, sitting cautiously on a small stool beside him, picking up his chopsticks and eating slowly. He ate very carefully, only picking the food in his own bowl, not daring to actively pick from the plates.

Seeing this, Zhu Changlan added a few pieces of chicken to his bowl, "Eat more. You need to conserve your energy for accompanying this Prince to the banquet this afternoon."
As he spoke, he also picked up a piece of chicken and slowly chewed it.

While eating, they chatted casually. Little Salary talked about some interesting things outside the palace, such as a new acrobat joining the acrobatic troupe in the west of the city, who could swallow swords and breathe fire; a storyteller in the teahouse in the south of the city, whose *Tales of Jianghu Heroes* was very exciting. Zhu Changlan listened with great interest, occasionally letting out a light laugh. He hadn't left the palace for too long and still had some yearning for the outside world. He remembered his days wandering the jianghu, seeking revenge and enjoying freedom, unlike now, where he was constrained everywhere.

He also thought of his time at the foot of Kunlun Mountain. At that time, he was a carefree spirit cat, spending his days catching fish, sunbathing, and cultivating. There was a clear lake at the foot of Kunlun Mountain, with tender fish meat. He would often jump into the lake to catch fish. After eating his fill, he would lie on an ancient tree by the lake to sunbathe. The days were simple and pure. Later, he accidentally ate an ancient spiritual fruit, which opened his intelligence, beginning his long cultivation journey.

After eating, Zhu Changlan returned to the recliner in the courtyard, sunbathing and drinking Lapsang Souchong tea, holding a folding fan and fanning himself gently. He closed his eyes, feeling the warmth of the sun, listening to the rustle of wind through the leaves and the distant birdsong, his whole body relaxing.

He also picked up the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* from the side, slowly flipping through it. He liked reading the descriptions of rare beasts in it, often imagining the appearance of those beasts based on the descriptions, sometimes even drawing them down. Among the scrolls in his study, there were several paintings of beasts from the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, with strange forms, lifelike.

After reading for a while, he felt a bit sleepy, putting down the book and closing his eyes again. His fingertips still curled unconsciously, like a cat retracting and extending its claws in a dream, with a faint smile on his lips. Perhaps in his dream, he returned to the foot of Kunlun Mountain, snuggling beside an ancient tree, sunbathing warmly, with a group of like-minded companions by his side.

Little Salary guarded nearby, looking at the sleeping Prince, couldn't help but shake his head slightly. This Ninth Prince was really an oddity. Clearly living in the deep palace, he could live so transparently and freely, as if all the disputes in the world had nothing to do with him. The Prince just didn't want to get involved in those disputes. He understood everything in his heart, but just didn't bother to care. This was good. Being an idle noble, living in peace, was always better than getting involved in those life-or-death struggles.

The sun gradually slanted westward, and the sunlight became much softer. Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, stretching lazily and yawning. He sat up, drinking a sip of warm tea, his eyes clear. "Little Salary, prepare the carriage. It's time to go to the Imperial Garden for the banquet." he said.

Little Salary quickly responded, turning to prepare. Zhu Changlan stood up, adjusting his clothes, picking up the folding fan from the side and fanning himself gently. His face still carried a gentle smile, still带着几分 laziness, but there was a hidden vigilance in his eyes.

This banquet was destined to be turbulent. But he wasn't afraid, because he was Immortal Meta Jade, a nine-lived cat demon who had lived for nearly a thousand years, and also the Ninth Prince of Great Ming's Wanli era. No matter what situation he encountered, he could handle it calmly.

He walked out of Tranquility Peace Palace, stepping onto the carriage. The carriage slowly moved forward, heading towards the Imperial Garden. Outside the window, the sun set, dyeing the sky a brilliant orange-red. Zhu Changlan looked at the scenery outside the window, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly, revealing a confident and calm smile.

This game had just begun. And he would be the final winner.
