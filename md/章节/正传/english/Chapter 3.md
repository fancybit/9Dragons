# Chapter 3: Palace Banquet Undercurrents, First Sign of Demon Aura

The carriage left the East Palace gate, the "creak" of wheels rolling over the bluestone road gradually subsiding. The sandalwood fragrance filling the carriage mixed with the residual osmanthus wine aroma in his sleeves, creating a lingering sense of reluctance. Zhu Changlan lowered the curtain, his fingers unconsciously caressing the golden nanmu dagger hanging at his waist—he had tied it on specially after returning from the East Palace, and the warm touch of the handle spread from his fingertips to his limbs, as if still feeling the warmth of the Crown Prince's palm.

"My Prince, would you like some warm water?" Xiaoluzi sat on the small stool outside the carriage, hearing no movement inside, he asked softly. He was already accustomed to his prince's silence, knowing that Zhu Changlan would always spend a moment alone in quiet contemplation after returning from the East Palace. Begonia petals outside the window still fell sporadically, sticking to the window like a thin layer of frost, trembling gently with the carriage's颠簸.

Zhu Changlan responded, and Xiaoluzi lifted a corner of the curtain, handing in a warm white porcelain cup. The cup was a gift from the Crown Prince, with a small orchid painted on the wall, the brushstrokes elegant, exactly Zhu Changlan's preferred style. He took the cup, taking a small sip, the warm water sliding down his throat, but unable to suppress the surging emotions in his heart. The Crown Prince's words "When the court stabilizes in the future, I'll allow you to travel outside the palace" still echoed in his ears: Kunlun's snow scenery, Jiangnan's osmanthus cakes, fish schools by the sea... these human scenes he had once遥望 from the demon world now had concrete expectations, and the source of these expectations was the elder brother who always protected him.

The carriage turned at a corner of the palace road, and a gust of evening wind carrying coldness钻了进来. Zhu Changlan subconsciously tightened his dark blue brocade robe. The fabric of this robe was top-quality tribute brocade from Jiangnan, and the Crown Prince had specially instructed the embroideress to add a thin layer of silk in the interlayer, both warm and not heavy. He remembered when he first entered the palace, in winter he could only wear coarse cotton jackets, the cold wind cutting into his collar like a knife, freezing his fingertips purple. It was the Crown Prince, on a snowy afternoon, who burst into Xian'an Palace holding a thick quilt, tucking it around him while red-eyed saying: "Ninth Brother, from now on, I will never let you freeze again."

At that time, the Crown Prince was only a teenager, yet he had already taken on the responsibility of protecting him. Over the years, the Crown Prince had given him countless gifts, from intimate clothing to daily tea sets, from books for leisure to the current self-defense dagger. Each one precisely hit his preferences, every detail hiding meticulous care. Zhu Changlan looked down at the intertwined lotus patterns on the dagger handle, his fingers tracing the smooth lines, making a silent vow in his heart: he couldn't just be the younger brother protected by the Crown Prince; he must quickly improve his cultivation. If one day the Crown Prince was in danger, he must also be able to stand up.

When he returned to Xian'an Palace, the sky was already completely dark. Xian'an Palace, located on the west side of the inner court, was specially arranged for Zhu Changlan by the Empress. The main hall hung the plaque "Ci An" (慈安), written by the Empress herself; the east side hall was the bedroom, the west side hall was the study, and the courtyard planted with several hundred-year-old osmanthus trees, personally planted by the Empress. The two red lanterns at the palace gate flickered in the evening wind, their light shining on the new branches of the osmanthus trees, making them flicker on and off. Xiaoluzi had already prepared dinner, placed on the square table in the east chamber: four dishes and one soup, all Zhu Changlan's favorite light dishes: stir-fried seasonal vegetables, steamed crucian carp, winter melon and kelp soup, a small plate of cold cucumber, and finally a bowl of warm lotus seed soup, soft and sweet, most nourishing for the stomach.

"My Prince, this crucian carp was just fished from the Imperial River this evening. I had someone cook it according to the East Palace kitchen's method, only adding ginger slices to remove the fishy smell. Please try if it suits your taste." Xiaoluzi said while serving food for Zhu Changlan. Zhu Changlan favored the craftsmanship of the East Palace kitchen, so Xiaoluzi had specially paid attention to learning it, although not as exquisite as the East Palace chef, it had a similar taste.

Zhu Changlan picked up his chopsticks,夹了一块鱼肉放进嘴里. The fish meat was tender, melting in his mouth, a faint fresh fragrance filling his mouth, indeed having a touch of the East Palace's taste. He nodded, softly saying: "Not bad, you've worked hard."

A smile appeared on Xiaoluzi's face, quickly saying: "I'm glad the Prince is satisfied. By the way, when the Prince returned from the East Palace, His Royal Highness sent a jar of newly brewed rice wine, saying that if you feel cold at night, you can drink a little to warm up, and specifically instructed not to drink too much, lest it hurt your stomach." With that, he took out a delicate pottery jar from under the table, with a note attached to it, written in the Crown Prince's strong and powerful handwriting: "Warm drinking is appropriate, just a small sip."

Zhu Changlan looked at the note, warmth welling up in his eyes. The Crown Prince was always like this, even thinking so周全 about such small matters. He signaled Xiaoluzi to pour a cup. The warm rice wine poured into the white porcelain cup, rippling slightly, its aroma rich, completely different from the osmanthus wine he brewed himself, but equally heartwarming.

After dinner, Zhu Changlan didn't return to the inner room immediately, but walked to the pear wood reclining chair in the courtyard and sat down. Xiaoluzi quickly brought a plain soft silk thin blanket, covering him, whispering: "My Prince, the night wind is cool, be careful not to catch a cold. Do you want me to brew another pot of hot tea?"

"No need, you go down to rest, I want to sit alone for a while." Zhu Changlan said.

Xiaoluzi responded, adding a few more words of caution: "If there's any movement at night, just call me," then quietly withdrew. Only Zhu Changlan remained in the courtyard. The evening wind brushed through the osmanthus tree branches, making a "沙沙" sound, intertwined with the insect chirps under the eaves, forming the unique silence of Xian'an Palace at night.

Zhu Changlan raised his head, looking at the stars in the sky. The stars were as numerous as broken diamonds, embedded in the pitch-black night sky, exceptionally bright. He remembered when he practiced under Kunlun Mountain, he often looked at the stars like this at night. At that time, the starry sky was also brilliant, but lacked the warmth of the human world. At that time, he was the high and mighty Xuan Yu True Immortal, with powerful strength, but always lonely, with only the howling cold wind and silent snow-capped mountains around him. No one ever warmed a cup of wine for him, tucked in his quilt for him, or cared about his food and clothing.

In these years as the Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, although he lived in the deep palace with many constraints, he felt a warmth he had never felt before. This warmth came from Crown Prince Zhu Changluo, the only light in this seemingly cold palace. He clutched the dagger at his waist, the warm touch of the wood coming through, the cloud patterns on the blade faintly glowing in the starlight. This dagger was the Crown Prince's heartfelt intention, and also his confidence.

Zhu Changlan took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and slowly circulated the spiritual power in his body. His cultivation path was different from human martial arts, more focused on the integration with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Although Xian'an Palace was secluded, it had abundant spiritual energy due to the flowers and trees in the courtyard. The evening wind carried the fragrance of plants, entering his body with his breath, intertwining with his spiritual power, slowly flowing through his limbs and bones.

Since obtaining the Kunlun jet-black jade sent by the Crown Prince, his cultivation had been much smoother. The calming effect of the jet-black jade allowed him to calm down faster, and now with the和田 warm jade at the end of the dagger handle, the speed of his spiritual power circulation was even faster than before. The warm spiritual energy of the warm jade merged with his own spiritual power, like a warm current, nourishing his meridians, making him feel warm all over.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, a flash of light in his eyes. He could feel that his cultivation had improved a small step again. Although there was still a distance from breaking through the bottleneck, it still made him happy. He stood up, moving his limbs, the dagger at his waist gently shaking, making a slight sound. He drew the dagger, looking at it under the starlight. The blade glinted with cold light, sharp beyond compare, but because of the rounded edge specially polished by the Crown Prince, it lacked some戾气.

Zhu Changlan gently swung the dagger, his movements light and smooth. He didn't use any complex moves, just simply waving it, feeling the weight and feel of the dagger. This dagger seemed tailor-made for him, exceptionally comfortable to hold, every swing precisely cutting through the evening wind, carrying a faint spiritual power fluctuation. With this dagger, if he encountered ordinary danger, he could also protect himself.

Just then, a slight footsteps came from outside the courtyard. The footsteps were very light, but still keenly caught by Zhu Changlan. He put away the dagger, warily looking towards the courtyard gate. Xian'an Palace was secluded, rarely visited on weekdays, and even less so at this hour. Could it be someone from Consort Zheng or the Third Prince?

The footsteps grew closer, finally stopping at the courtyard gate. A familiar figure appeared in the light and shadow—it was Xiaoxizi, the Crown Prince's attendant. Zhu Changlan breathed a sigh of relief, asking: "Xiaoxizi? Why are you here so late?"

Xiaoxizi quickly walked into the courtyard, bowing and saying: "Greetings to the Ninth Prince. His Royal Highness the Crown Prince worried that you might catch a cold sitting alone in the courtyard at night, so he specially sent me to bring a cloak. His Highness also said, if you haven't rested yet, to tell you that the matters in the court today have been almost handled, so you don't need to worry, just rest at ease." With that, he handed over a black cloak, made of high-quality silk, soft in texture, embroidered with extremely light cloud patterns, exactly the one the Crown Prince usually wore.

Zhu Changlan took the cloak, his fingertips touching the warm fabric, his heart warming. The Crown Prince even knew he was sitting in the courtyard, presumably having sent someone to secretly take care of him. He wrapped the cloak tightly around himself, the faint sandalwood scent of the Crown Prince still lingering on it, making him feel particularly at ease. "Please thank the Crown Prince for me, I'm sorry to have him worried."

"The Prince is too polite; this is what His Highness should do." Xiaoxizi said with a smile, "His Highness also ordered that if you need anything at all, you can send someone to report to the East Palace at any time, no matter how late, His Highness will send someone over. I won't disturb the Prince's rest anymore, I'll take my leave."

Zhu Changlan nodded, watching Xiaoxizi quietly leave. The courtyard returned to silence, the evening wind still blowing, but because of the cloak, it was less cold. He sat back on the reclining chair, his fingers caressing the cloud patterns on the cloak, but his heart gradually calmed down—tomorrow was the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet, and the Crown Prince specifically mentioned that the court was stable, probably hinting at the undercurrents at the banquet.

The Empress Dowager had always favored the Third Prince Zhu Changxun, and Consort Zheng had been using the Empress Dowager's power to cultivate cronies in the court. This birthday banquet was bound to be a place where various forces secretly contended. The Crown Prince told him to rest assured, but as the Crown Prince's closest brother, he had long been a thorn in Consort Zheng's side. At the banquet, he was probably in for some targeting. He clutched the dagger at his waist, the warm touch of the warm jade making him slightly at ease. Now that his cultivation had improved slightly, and with this dagger for self-defense, even if something happened, he might not be unable to protect himself.

The next morning, just as the sky was dawning, Xian'an Palace became lively. Xiaoluzi led several palace maids in, carrying already prepared clothes and jewelry, softly saying: "My Prince, today is the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet. His Royal Highness specially sent this set of ceremonial clothes, saying it both fits the Prince's identity and isn't too ostentatious."

Zhu Changlan looked up, seeing that the ceremonial clothes were made of moon-white brocade, the fabric embroidered with silver thread cloud patterns, shimmering faintly in the morning light. The collar and cuffs were embroidered with a circle of simple intertwined lotus patterns with green thread, exactly his preferred elegant style. The fabric of this set of ceremonial clothes was even better than his usual brocade robes, warm to the touch. Presumably, the Crown Prince had spent a lot of effort to find it.

The palace maids stepped forward to dress him, their movements gentle and skilled. The moon-white ceremonial clothes made his skin even fairer, his figure even slimmer and taller. Xiaoluzi took out a white jade hairpin, the jade warm and smooth, carved with simple orchid patterns, a birthday gift from the Crown Prince last year. "The Prince looks even more elegant wearing this jade hairpin." Xiaoluzi said with a smile.

Zhu Changlan looked in the bronze mirror. The young man in the mirror had清秀 eyebrows, gentle eyes, and the moon-white ceremonial clothes made him have an otherworldly temperament, showing no trace of the gloom of living in the deep palace. He gently stroked the hairpin, thinking to himself: The Crown Prince is always so thoughtful, even considering the palace banquet ceremonial clothes so周全 for him.

After getting ready, Zhu Changlan took Xiaoluzi to the East Palace. According to convention, he needed to go to Shoukang Palace with the Crown Prince to wish the Empress Dowager a happy birthday, then attend the palace banquet together. On the way to the East Palace, Zhu Changlan lifted a corner of the carriage curtain, watching the palace people and eunuchs coming and going on the palace road. Each had a cautious smile on their face, but their eyes couldn't hide their tension. Obviously, today's palace banquet had everyone in the palace on edge.

When he arrived at the East Palace, Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was already waiting at the palace gate. He was wearing a bright yellow Crown Prince ceremonial robe today, a jade belt around his waist inlaid with a large piece of和田 jade, his features handsome, his eyebrows carrying a hint of calm authority. Yet when he saw Zhu Changlan, his expression instantly softened. "Ninth Brother, you're here." The Crown Prince stepped forward, looking him up and down, a hint of approval in his eyes: "This ceremonial robe suits you very well, I indeed chose correctly."

"Thank you, Elder Brother." Zhu Changlan bowed and said.

"No need for formalities." The Crown Prince helped him up, softly admonishing: "At today's palace banquet, there might be movements from the Empress Dowager and Consort Zheng's side. Stay by my side, don't leave casually. Listen and watch more, speak less. If someone targets you, don't pay attention—with me here." His tone was light, but with undeniable firmness.

Zhu Changlan nodded: "I know, Elder Brother."

The two sat in the carriage side by side, heading to Shoukang Palace. Inside the carriage, the Crown Prince briefly told Zhu Changlan about today's palace banquet arrangements, and also mentioned several officials to pay attention to—all cronies of Consort Zheng and the Third Prince. "If these people make trouble for you at the banquet or probe with words, just perfunctory them, don't argue with them." The Crown Prince carefully admonished, afraid that Zhu Changlan would suffer a loss.

Zhu Changlan listened carefully, memorizing the names mentioned by the Crown Prince one by one. Today, the Crown Prince had to deal with the probing of court officials, guard against the暗算 of Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, and also distract himself to protect him—he must be very hard. "Elder Brother, you也要多加小心." He said softly, his eyes full of concern.

The Crown Prince smiled, patting his shoulder: "Don't worry, I have my own sense of propriety."

Soon, the carriage arrived at Shoukang Palace. The palace was decorated with lanterns and festoons, a festive scene. The palace gate was filled with princes, nobles, and court officials here to wish the Empress Dowager a happy birthday. Each wore formal ceremonial clothes, with happy smiles on their faces. The Empress Dowager's personal palace maid saw the Crown Prince and Zhu Changlan arrive, quickly stepping forward to bow: "Greetings to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, greetings to the Ninth Prince. The Empress Dowager is already waiting inside, let this servant lead you in."

The two followed the palace maid into the main hall of Shoukang Palace. The hall was already filled with people. On the throne at the top sat a雍容老妇人, the current Empress Dowager. She was wearing a deep red brocade robe embroidered with complex phoenix patterns, head adorned with gold hairpins, bejeweled, her eyes sharp. Beside her sat the Emperor, his face威严, his expression calm, showing no particular emotion. Consort Zheng sat on the other side of the Emperor, wearing a phoenix robe, her makeup精致, a得体 smile on her lips, but her eyes were quietly observing everyone in the hall.

"Son (Younger Brother) pays respects to Father, pays respects to Mother, pays respects to Empress Dowager, wishing Empress Dowager happiness as boundless as the East Sea and longevity exceeding Nanshan Mountain." The Crown Prince and Zhu Changlan bowed together.

"Rise." The Empress Dowager's voice was a bit old, but still full of energy. She looked at the Crown Prince, nodding, but when her gaze fell on Zhu Changlan, it carried a hint of faint alienation: "Ninth Prince, rise as well. It's been a long time, you've grown more energetic."

"Thank you for Your Majesty's praise." Zhu Changlan responded softly, his tone respectful but not servile.

The two sat in their designated positions. Zhu Changlan's seat was right next to the Crown Prince, just able to feel the steady aura emanating from the Crown Prince. He raised his eyes and scanned the hall, seeing Third Prince Zhu Changxun sitting beside Consort Zheng, wearing a purple brocade robe, his features handsome but carrying a hint of flamboyance. He felt Zhu Changlan's gaze, looked over, a trace of disdain flashing in his eyes, then quickly replaced with a fake smile, nodding at Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan withdrew his gaze, sneering in his heart. He naturally knew Zhu Changxun's hostility towards him, just because the Crown Prince favored him. He didn't bother to argue with Zhu Changxun, only sitting quietly, listening to the birthday wishes from everyone in the hall to the Empress Dowager, while keeping an eye on the movements in the hall.

After the birthday banquet officially began, palace maids brought in one精致 dish after another, filling each table. The dishes were extremely丰盛, with rare delicacies and exotic animals, each as精致 as a work of art. The hall also filled with melodious music, and a group of dancers in华丽 costumes danced in the center of the hall, their movements graceful, drawing bursts of admiration from the crowd.

However, beneath this seemingly festive and harmonious atmosphere, there surged an undercurrent. Zhu Changlan敏锐ly noticed that many officials in the hall were exchanging glances in secret, either looking at the Crown Prince, or at Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, their eyes full of probing and calculation. Consort Zheng occasionally whispered to the officials beside her, her mouth curving into a subtle smile, plotting something unknown.

"Ninth Brother, try this Hibiscus Chicken, it's the signature dish of the Shoukang Palace kitchen, tastes good." The Crown Prince put a piece of chicken into Zhu Changlan's bowl, softly saying, breaking his thoughts.

Zhu Changlan came back to his senses, nodding, picking up his chopsticks and taking a bite. The chicken was tender and smooth, with excellent texture, indeed delicious. He smiled at the Crown Prince: "Thank you, Elder Brother, it's delicious."

Just then, Third Prince Zhu Changxun stood up holding a wine cup, saying to the Crown Prince and Zhu Changlan: "Elder Brother, Ninth Brother, today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, such a festive day, younger brother敬 you a cup." His tone seemed respectful, but his eyes carried a hint of provocation.

The Crown Prince picked up his wine cup,淡淡道: "Third Brother is thoughtful."

Zhu Changlan also picked up his wine cup, about to raise it in response, but suddenly frowned. He敏锐ly detected an extremely faint strange aura coming from Zhu Changxun—this aura was cold and obscure, completely different from human aura, carrying a hint of demoness. This aura was very faint, almost imperceptible. If he hadn't cultivated for many years and been extremely sensitive to demon auras, he wouldn't have noticed it at all.

Zhu Changlan was shocked: Could it be that Zhu Changxun was related to the demon race? Or was there someone from the demon race around him? He不动声色地打量着 Zhu Changxun, seeing him with a ruddy complexion and a proud smile, looking no different from ordinary people, with no signs of demon aura leaking out. Could he have felt wrong?

"Ninth Brother, why aren't you drinking? Could it be that you don't give me face?" Zhu Changxun saw that Zhu Changlan hadn't raised his cup for a long time, his tone带着几分不满, his voice also rising a bit, causing many people in the hall to turn their attention to them.

The Crown Prince noticed Zhu Changlan's abnormality, slightly frowning, saying to Zhu Changxun: "Third Brother, Ninth Brother has been unwell recently, not suitable for drinking. This cup, elder brother替他喝了." With that, he reached for Zhu Changlan's wine cup.

"Elder Brother, that's not acceptable." Zhu Changxun stopped the Crown Prince, his tone aggressive: "Today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, a day of universal celebration. Even if Ninth Brother is unwell, he should敬 the Empress Dowager a cup to show his intentions. If he refuses to drink even a cup, isn't that disrespectful to the Empress Dowager?"

As soon as these words were spoken, the atmosphere in the hall instantly became tense. The Empress Dowager's face slightly sank, her gaze falling on Zhu Changlan with scrutiny. Consort Zheng chimed in from the side: "Yes, Ninth Prince, today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, you really should敬 the Empress Dowager a cup. If you're unwell, just drink a little."

Zhu Changlan understood, this was Zhu Changxun deliberately targeting him, wanting to embarrass him in front of everyone. He suppressed the doubt in his heart, picked up the wine cup, bowing to the Empress Dowager: "Empress Dowager, this younger brother并非不敬, but has indeed been unwell recently. Today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, this younger brother愿以茶代酒, wishing the Empress Dowager good health and long life."

"Tea instead of wine?" Zhu Changxun sneered: "Ninth Brother, that's too insincere, isn't it? Would a single cup of wine hurt you? Or do you simply not take the Empress Dowager seriously?"

Just then, Zhu Changlan once again detected that cold demon aura, this time clearer, and it didn't come from Zhu Changxun himself, but from a personal eunuch behind him. That eunuch lowered his head, standing behind Zhu Changxun, looking extremely inconspicuous, but Zhu Changlan could feel that the demon aura was emanating from him.

Zhu Changlan suddenly understood: it was Zhu Changxun's personal eunuch who was from the demon race. No wonder Zhu Changxun had been acting more and more arrogant lately; he probably had the demon race secretly helping him. He不动声色地收回目光, knowing that this was not the time to expose this matter. If he rashly spoke of the demon aura, it would only cause panic, and might even be反咬一口 by Consort Zheng, saying he was spreading rumors.

"Third Brother, stop talking nonsense." The Crown Prince's tone became stern, carrying a hint of威严: "Ninth Brother's illness, I've known about it for a long time. Using tea instead of wine is also a gesture of goodwill. The Empress Dowager is benevolent, she will not blame him."

The Empress Dowager's face softened. She looked at the Crown Prince, then at Zhu Changlan, slowly saying: "Alright, Ninth Prince is unwell, don't force him. Tea instead of wine,哀家 accepts it." Although she favored Zhu Changxun, she also knew the weight of the Crown Prince and didn't want to make a scene on her birthday.

Zhu Changxun saw the Empress Dowager speak, so he had to give up, but still unwillingly glared at Zhu Changlan,悻悻 returning to his seat. The atmosphere in the hall eased slightly, music resumed, and the dancers continued dancing, as if the previous episode had never happened.

But Zhu Changlan's heart couldn't be calm. The appearance of that demon aura made him realize that in this deep palace, there were not only power struggles among humans, but also possibly hidden demon race forces. The demon race had always been at odds with humans, and now someone had infiltrated the palace, attaching themselves to Zhu Changxun—what were their plans? If this was allowed to continue, it would not only threaten the Crown Prince's safety, but might even shake the foundation of the Ming Dynasty.

He quietly looked at the Crown Prince, seeing him holding a wine cup, talking with the officials beside him, his expression calm, seemingly not noticing anything unusual. Zhu Changlan knew that the Crown Prince was a mortal, unable to detect the presence of demon aura. He had to find a way to inform the Crown Prince of this matter as soon as possible, but without exposing his own identity.

The palace banquet continued, but Zhu Changlan had no mood to taste the dishes or appreciate the singing and dancing, his mind always thinking about the demon aura. He occasionally looked at the eunuch behind Zhu Changxun, carefully observing his every move. The eunuch始终 lowered his head, respectfully standing behind Zhu Changxun, occasionally pouring wine and serving food for him, his movements skilled, looking no different from ordinary eunuchs. But Zhu Changlan could feel that his demon aura, although deliberately suppressed, was still slowly flowing.

Near the end of the palace banquet, the eunuch excused himself to use the restroom, quietly leaving the main hall. Zhu Changlan's heart moved, saying softly to the Crown Prince: "Elder Brother, I need to use the restroom."

The Crown Prince nodded, admonishing: "Be careful, go and come back quickly."

Zhu Changlan stood up, quietly following behind. He followed the guidance of that demon aura, all the way to the secluded corridor on the west side of Shoukang Palace. At this time, the corridor was empty, only the sound of evening wind brushing through the corridor pillars. The eunuch was standing at the corner of the corridor, back to him, seemingly talking to someone.

"The matter instructed by the master has been completed. Zhu Changxun completely trusts this subordinate now. In the future, this subordinate will definitely follow the master's plan,牵制 the Crown Prince." The eunuch's voice was no longer the usual high-pitched falsetto, but became deep and hoarse, with a hint of demoness texture.

Zhu Changlan held his breath, hiding behind the corridor pillar, listening quietly. He could feel that besides this eunuch's demon aura, there was another, more powerful demon aura lingering nearby, obviously his "master."

"Well done." A cold voice came from the darkness: "Remember, do not expose your identity. When the time is ripe, we will seize the Ming Dynasty in one fell swoop, making humans our slaves. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo is the greatest obstacle; you must find a way to alienate him from the Emperor and Empress Dowager as soon as possible, preferably making him lose all reputation. As for that Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, the Crown Prince favors him greatly. If there's a chance, eliminate him, cutting off the Crown Prince's right-hand man."

"This subordinate understands." The eunuch said respectfully.

Zhu Changlan's heart sank, never expecting the demon race to have such ambitions, wanting to seize the Ming Dynasty. Moreover, their targets were not only the Crown Prince, but also him. He clutched the dagger at his waist, his fingertips slightly white, making a silent vow in his heart to stop their conspiracy.

Just then, that powerful demon aura suddenly struck in his direction, obviously detecting his presence. "Who's there?" The cold voice sounded,带着几分警惕.

Zhu Changlan knew he was exposed, no longer hiding, stepping out from behind the pillar, looking coldly at the eunuch and the figure in the darkness. "Demon race remnant, how dare you infiltrate the palace, plotting rebellion."

The eunuch turned around, his face twisting into a狰狞 smile. His ordinary face gradually distorted, his eyes glowing green, the demon aura on his body no longer suppressed, becoming extremely浓郁. "I didn't expect to be discovered by you.既然如此, you can stay here!" With that, he扑向 Zhu Changlan, his hands transforming into sharp claws, carrying a fierce cold wind.

Zhu Changlan was already prepared, dodging his attack sideways while drawing the golden nanmu dagger from his waist. The dagger glinted with cold light under the moonlight, the warm spiritual energy of the warm jade merging with his own spiritual power, spreading along the dagger to form a faint halo. This dagger was forged from Western Region refined iron, able to restrain evil, a sharp weapon against the demon race.

"Do you think you can hurt me with this?" Zhu Changlan sneered, holding the dagger and taking the initiative to attack the eunuch. His movements were light and smooth, with the enhancement of spiritual power, every swing precise. The dagger collided with the eunuch's claws, emitting a "ding" sound, sparks flying.

The eunuch obviously didn't expect Zhu Changlan to have such strength, a flash of surprise in his eyes, then becoming even more狰狞. "You're not an ordinary human? Could it be that you're also from the demon race?"

"What I am, you don't need to know." Zhu Changlan's tone was cold, his attacks becoming more fierce. His spiritual power continuously poured into the dagger, the light of the dagger becoming brighter. Every attack carried the power to restrain evil, making the eunuch gradually feel吃力.

The demon aura in the darkness also stirred, seemingly wanting to help, but hesitating. Obviously, it didn't want to expose its identity in the palace, for fear of causing a bigger commotion.

"Since you won't say, then die!" The eunuch roared, the demon power in his body surging, a faint black gas surrounding him,扑向 Zhu Changlan again.

Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, no longer holding back, pouring all his spiritual power into the dagger. The dagger instantly burst into dazzling white light. He met the eunuch's attack, stabbing fiercely. "噗嗤"一声, the dagger precisely pierced the eunuch's heart.

The eunuch's body stiffened, the green light in his eyes gradually fading, the black gas on his body also dissipating, returning to the appearance of an ordinary eunuch, falling to the ground, breathless. That faint demon aura also completely disappeared.

The powerful demon aura in the darkness, sensing that its companion was killed, let out an angry roar, but still didn't dare to show itself, only unwillingly leaving. Zhu Changlan could feel that demon aura rapidly departing, obviously afraid of being chased by him.

Zhu Changlan put away the dagger, gasping for breath. Although the battle was short, it consumed a lot of his spiritual power. He looked at the eunuch's body on the ground, knowing that this place was not safe to stay for long, so he quickly left the corridor, returning to the main hall of Shoukang Palace.

At this time, the palace banquet was nearing its end, and everyone was preparing to get up and leave. Seeing Zhu Changlan return, the Crown Prince quickly asked: "Ninth Brother, why did you take so long? Are you okay?"

"It's okay, just encountered a little thing on the way, delayed for a moment." Zhu Changlan said softly. He didn't immediately tell the Crown Prince about the demon race, fearing it would cause panic in the main hall, and also fearing that it would be overheard by someone with ulterior motives.

Seeing his normal expression, the Crown Prince放下心来. The two followed everyone to bid farewell to the Empress Dowager, Emperor, and Consort Zheng, then left Shoukang Palace together, taking the carriage back to the East Palace.

As the carriage left Shoukang Palace, Zhu Changlan slowly松了口气. He looked at the Crown Prince, seriously saying: "Elder Brother, today at the palace banquet, I discovered a big secret."

Seeing his serious expression, the Crown Prince knew the matter was not simple, quickly asking: "Ninth Brother, what is it?"

"A personal eunuch beside Zhu Changxun is from the demon race." Zhu Changlan lowered his voice, "Moreover, he has a more powerful demon master behind him. Their goal is to seize the Ming Dynasty, and they also want to deal with you and me."

Hearing this, the Crown Prince's face instantly became heavy. Although he didn't believe in ghosts and gods, he knew that Zhu Changlan wouldn't lie to him, and Zhu Changlan's identity was special, so it wasn't surprising that he could detect these things. "Is this true?"

"Absolutely true." Zhu Changlan nodded, telling the Crown Prince in detail what he had heard in the corridor and the battle with the eunuch, "I have already killed that demon eunuch, but his master escaped. I can be sure that there are definitely other demon race members hidden in the palace. We must quickly find a way to deal with this."

The Crown Prince was silent for a moment, his brow furrowed, his mind racing. The demon race infiltrating the palace, plotting rebellion—this was no small matter. If not handled properly, it would not only cause turmoil in the court, but might even endanger the foundation of the Ming Dynasty. He looked at Zhu Changlan, his tone firm: "Ninth Brother, you did well. This matter is of great importance and shouldn't be publicized. When we return to the East Palace, we'll discuss countermeasures in detail. Don't worry, with me here, I will definitely protect you and guard this Ming Dynasty."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince's determined eyes, warmth welling up in his heart. With the Crown Prince here, no matter how great the difficulty, they could face it together. The carriage slowly moved on the palace road, the moonlight洒在 the carriage, carrying a faint glow. The undercurrents of the palace banquet hadn't subsided yet, and the appearance of the demon aura added even more crisis to this deep palace. The road ahead was destined not to be smooth. But Zhu Changlan felt no fear in his heart, because he was no longer alone—with the Crown Prince as his elder brother, with the dagger in his hand, with the warmth in his heart, he could bravely face all storms.
