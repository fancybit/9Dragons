# Chapter 3: Palace Banquet Undercurrents, Demon Aura Revealed

The carriage pulled away from the Eastern Palace gate, the "creak" of wheels rolling over slate-paved roads gradually fading. Inside the carriage, the scent of sandalwood and the lingering aroma of osmanthus wine interwove, painting a scene of reluctant affection. Zhu Changlan lowered the curtain, his fingers unconsciously stroking the golden nanmu dagger hanging from his waist——something he had deliberately fastened after returning from the Eastern Palace. The warm touch of the hilt spread from his fingertips to his entire body, as if he could still feel the Crown Prince's palm temperature.

"Your Highness, would you like some warm water?" Little Luzi, sitting on a small wooden stool outside the carriage, asked softly when he heard no movement inside. He was already accustomed to his master's silence, knowing that every time Zhu Changlan returned from the Eastern Palace, he would always sit quietly in contemplation for a while. outside the window, crabapple petals still fell sporadically, sticking to the carriage window like a thin layer of pink frost, trembling gently with the carriage's jolting.

Zhu Changlan responded, and Little Luzi lifted a corner of the curtain, handing in a warm white porcelain cup. The cup was a gift from the Crown Prince, with a small orchid painted on the wall in elegant brushstrokes, exactly Zhu Changlan's preferred style. He took the cup and took a small sip. The warm water slid down his throat, but it couldn't suppress the emotions churning in his heart. The Crown Prince's words, "When the court is stable, I'll let you travel outside the palace," still echoed in his ears. The snow scenery of Kunlun, the osmanthus cakes of Jiangnan, the fish schools by the sea... These human spectacles he had once gazed at from the demon realm now had concrete expectations, and the source of these expectations was the elder brother who had always protected him.

As the carriage turned the corner of the palace path, a gust of evening wind carrying cold air crept in, and Zhu Changlan subconsciously wrapped his stone-blue brocade robe tighter. The fabric was the finest tribute brocade from Jiangnan, and the Crown Prince had specifically instructed the embroiderer to add a thin layer of silk in the interlayer, making it both warm and light. He remembered when he first entered the palace, in winter he could only wear a coarse cotton jacket, and the cold wind would cut into his collar like a knife, making his fingertips turn purple. It was the Crown Prince who, on a snowy afternoon, burst into Tranquility Peace Palace holding a thick quilt, tucking him in while red-eyed and saying: "Ninth Brother, from now on, I will never let you freeze again."

At that time, the Crown Prince was just a teenager of thirteen or fourteen, but he had already shouldered the responsibility of protecting him. Over the years, the Crown Prince had given him countless gifts, from intimate clothing to daily tea sets, from books for entertainment to the current self-defense dagger. Each item precisely matched his preferences, and every detail hid meticulous care. Zhu Changlan looked down at the intertwined lotus pattern on the dagger hilt, his fingers tracing those smooth lines, silently resolving in his heart: He couldn't just be the brother protected by the Crown Prince. He needed to improve his cultivation as soon as possible, so that if the Crown Prince was ever in danger, he could step forward to protect him.

By the time they returned to Tranquility Peace Palace, the sky had completely darkened. Tranquility Peace Palace was located on the western side of the inner palace, a residence specially arranged for Zhu Changlan by the Empress. The main hall hung the plaque "Ci'an" (Benevolent Peace), written in the Empress's own hand; the east side hall served as the bedroom, and the west side hall as the study. In the courtyard, there were several centennial osmanthus trees, planted by the Empress herself. The two red lanterns at the palace gate swayed in the evening wind, their light flickering, casting the new branches of the osmanthus trees in the courtyard into a dance of light and shadow. Little Luzi had already had dinner prepared, laid out on an eight immortals table in the eastern side room. There were four dishes and one soup, all Zhu Changlan's favorite light dishes: stir-fried seasonal vegetables, steamed crucian carp, winter melon and kelp soup, a small plate of cold cucumber salad, and finally a bowl of warm lotus seed soup, soft and sweet, perfect for nourishing the stomach.

"Your Highness, this carp was just fished from the imperial river this evening. I had someone cook it according to the Eastern Palace kitchen's method, using only ginger slices to remove the fishy smell. Please taste if it suits your palate." Little Luzi said as he served the dishes for Zhu Changlan. Zhu Changlan preferred the Eastern Palace kitchen's cooking, so Little Luzi had deliberately learned to make it. Although not as exquisite as the Eastern Palace head chef's, it was somewhat similar in taste.

Zhu Changlan picked up his chopsticks, took a piece of fish in his mouth. The fish was tender, melting in the mouth, and a faint fresh aroma filled his mouth, indeed carrying a hint of the Eastern Palace's flavor. He nodded and said softly: "It's good, you've worked hard."

Little Luzi's face lit up with a smile, and he quickly said: "I'm glad Your Highness is satisfied. Oh, by the way, when you returned from the Eastern Palace, the Crown Prince sent a jar of newly brewed rice wine, saying that if you feel cold at night, you can drink a little to warm up. He specifically instructed that you shouldn't drink too much, to avoid hurting your stomach." With that, he took out an exquisite ceramic jar from under the table, with a note attached. On it was the Crown Prince's powerful and forceful handwriting: "Warm before drinking, sip only."

Looking at the note, warmth welled up in Zhu Changlan's eyes. The Crown Prince was always like this, thinking through even the smallest details. He gestured for Little Luzi to pour a cup. The warm rice wine poured into the white porcelain cup, creating faint ripples, with a mellow aroma, completely different from the osmanthus wine he brewed himself, but equally heartwarming.

After dinner, Zhu Changlan didn't immediately return to his inner chamber. Instead, he walked to the pearwood reclining chair in the courtyard and sat down. Little Luzi quickly brought a plain silk thin blanket, covering him with it, and said softly: "Your Highness, the night wind is cold, be careful not to catch cold. Would you like me to brew a pot of hot tea?"

"No need, you can go rest. I want to sit alone for a while." Zhu Changlan said.

Little Luzi responded, then added a few more words: "If there's any movement at night, call me anytime," before tiptoeing away. Only Zhu Changlan remained in the courtyard. The evening wind brushed the osmanthus tree leaves, making a "rustling" sound, interweaving with the insect chirping under the eaves, creating a unique tranquility for Tranquility Peace Palace at night.

Zhu Changlan looked up at the stars in the sky. The stars were as numerous as diamond shards, embedded in the pitch-black night sky, exceptionally bright. He remembered when he cultivated under Kunlun Mountain, he would often look at the stars like this at night. Back then, the starry sky was equally brilliant, but lacked the warmth of the human world. At that time, he was the aloof Immortal Meta Jade, with only howling cold wind and silent snow-capped mountains by his side. No one had ever warmed a cup of wine for him, tucked him in, or cared about his food and clothing.

During these years as Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, although he lived in the deep palace with many restraints, he had felt a warmth he had never experienced before. This warmth came from Crown Prince Zhu Changluo, the only light in this seemingly cold palace. He tightened his grip on the dagger at his waist, the warm wooden touch spreading from his fingertips. The cloud patterns on the blade glinted faintly in the starlight. This dagger was the Crown Prince's thoughtfulness, and also his confidence.

Zhu Changlan took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and slowly circulated the spiritual energy within his body. His cultivation method was different from human martial arts, focusing more on the fusion of heavenly and earthly spiritual energy. Although Tranquility Peace Palace was secluded, the spiritual energy was relatively abundant due to the flowers and trees in the courtyard. The evening wind, carrying the fragrance of plants and trees, entered his body with his breath, interweaving with his spiritual energy and slowly flowing through every limb and bone.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhu Changlan slowly opened his eyes, a glint of light flashing in them. He could feel that his cultivation had improved slightly. Although he was still far from breaking through the bottleneck, it still filled him with joy. He stood up, stretched his limbs, and the dagger at his waist swayed slightly, making a soft sound. He drew the dagger and looked at it in the starlight. The blade glinted coldly, extremely sharp, but with the rounded edges specially polished by the Crown Prince, it lacked hostility.

Zhu Changlan gently waved the dagger, his movements light and fluid. He didn't use any complex martial arts moves, just simple swings, feeling the weight and texture of the dagger. This dagger seemed tailor-made for him, comfortable to hold in his hand. Every swing precisely cut through the evening breeze, carrying faint spiritual energy fluctuations. With this dagger, he could protect himself if he encountered ordinary danger.

Just then, a faint sound of footsteps came from outside the courtyard. Although the footsteps were light, Zhu Changlan keenly detected them. He sheathed the dagger and looked warily at the courtyard gate. Tranquility Peace Palace was secluded, rarely visited on ordinary days, and there would be no visitors at this hour. Could it be someone from Consort Zheng or the Third Prince?

The footsteps grew closer, finally stopping at the courtyard gate. A familiar figure appeared in the light——it was Little Xizi, the Crown Prince's page boy. Zhu Changlan breathed a sigh of relief and asked: "Little Xizi? Why are you here so late?"

Little Xizi quickly entered the courtyard, bowed respectfully, and said: "Greetings to the Ninth Prince. The Crown Prince was worried that you might catch cold sitting alone in the courtyard at night, so he specially sent me to bring you this cloak. His Highness also said that if you haven't rested yet, let me tell you that today's court matters have been mostly handled, so you don't need to worry and should rest peacefully." With that, he handed over a black cloak. The cloak was made of fine silk, soft in texture, with very faint cloud patterns embroidered on it——it was the one the Crown Prince usually wore.

Zhu Changlan took the cloak, his fingers touching the warm fabric, and his heart felt warm and comforted. The Crown Prince even knew he was sitting in the courtyard, presumably having someone secretly watching over him. He wrapped the cloak tightly around himself; it still carried the faint sandalwood scent from the Crown Prince, making him feel particularly at ease. "Please thank Imperial Brother for me, and tell him I appreciate his concern."

"Your Highness is too kind, this is what His Highness should do." Little Xizi smiled and said, "His Highness also instructed that if you need anything, you can send someone to the Eastern Palace at any time, no matter how late, and he will send someone over. I won't disturb Your Highness's rest any longer, so I'll take my leave now."

Zhu Changlan nodded, watching Little Xizi tiptoe away. The courtyard returned to silence. The evening wind still blew, but with the cloak around him, it felt less cold. He sat back on the reclining chair, his fingers tracing the cloud patterns on the cloak, but his heart gradually calmed down——tomorrow was the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet. The Crown Prince's mention of court stability today was likely hinting at the undercurrents at the banquet.

The Empress Dowager had always favored Third Prince Zhu Changxun, and Consort Zheng, relying on the Empress Dowager's power, had cultivated her own faction in the court. This birthday banquet was sure to be a place where various forces secretly vied for power. The Crown Prince told him to rest assured, but as the Crown Prince's closest brother, he had long been a thorn in Consort Zheng's side. At the banquet, he was bound to be targeted. He tightened his grip on the dagger at his waist. The warm jade's touch slightly comforted him. Now that his cultivation had improved slightly and he had this dagger for self-defense, even if something unexpected happened, he might still be able to protect himself.

The next morning, as dawn was breaking, Tranquility Peace Palace came alive. Little Luzi led several palace maids in, holding prepared clothes and jewelry, and said softly: "Your Highness, today is the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet. The Crown Prince specially sent this formal attire, saying it is both suitable for your status and not too ostentatious."

Zhu Changlan looked up and saw that the formal attire was made of moon-white brocade, secretly embroidered with silver cloud patterns that glinted faintly in the morning light. The collar and cuffs were embroidered with a circle of simple intertwined lotus flowers in blue thread, exactly his preferred elegant and simple style. The fabric was superior to the brocade robes he usually wore, warm to the touch. The Crown Prince must have spent a lot of thought finding it.

The palace maids stepped forward to help him change, their movements gentle and skillful. The moon-white formal attire made his skin even fairer, and his figure even slimmer and more upright. Little Luzi then took out a white jade hairpin, warm in texture, carved with a simple orchid pattern——a birthday gift from the Crown Prince last year. "You look even more elegant with this jade hairpin, Your Highness." Little Luzi said with a smile.

Zhu Changlan looked at himself in the bronze mirror. The young man in the mirror had fine features, gentle eyes, and the moon-white formal attire made him look ethereal, with no trace of the gloom of living in the deep palace. He gently touched the hairpin, thinking to himself: The Crown Prince is always so thoughtful, even considering his banquet attire so thoroughly.

After getting ready, Zhu Changlan took Little Luzi to the Eastern Palace. According to custom, he needed to go to Shoukang Palace with the Crown Prince to pay respects to the Empress Dowager, then attend the banquet together. On the way to the Eastern Palace in the carriage, Zhu Changlan lifted a corner of the curtain and looked at the palace maids and eunuchs coming and going on the palace path. Everyone had careful smiles on their faces, but could not hide the tension in their eyes. Clearly, today's banquet had everyone in the palace on edge.

When they arrived at the Eastern Palace, Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was already waiting at the gate. He was wearing a bright yellow crown prince's formal attire, with a jade belt around his waist inlaid with a large Hetian jade. His face was handsome, with a calm and majestic air between his eyebrows, but it instantly softened when he saw Zhu Changlan. "Ninth Brother, you're here." The Crown Prince stepped forward, looked him up and down, a flash of approval in his eyes. "This formal attire suits you well, I chose correctly."

"Thank you, Imperial Brother." Zhu Changlan bowed respectfully.

"No need for formalities." The Crown Prince helped him up and whispered a warning: "At today's banquet, there might be moves from the Empress Dowager and Consort Zheng. Stay by my side, don't leave casually. Listen more, see more, speak less. If someone targets you, ignore them, I'm here." His tone was soft but carried unquestionable firmness.

Zhu Changlan nodded: "I understand, Imperial Brother."

The two sat side by side in the carriage, heading to Shoukang Palace. Inside the carriage, the Crown Prince briefly told Zhu Changlan about today's banquet arrangements and mentioned several officials to watch out for——all confidants of Consort Zheng and the Third Prince. "If these people make trouble for you at the banquet or probe you with words, just brush them off, don't argue with them." The Crown Prince carefully instructed, fearing Zhu Changlan might suffer a loss.

Zhu Changlan listened carefully, memorizing the names the Crown Prince mentioned. Today, the Crown Prince had to deal with the court officials' probes, guard against plots from Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, and still distract himself to protect him——it must be exhausting. "Imperial Brother, you should also be careful." He said softly, his eyes full of concern.

The Crown Prince smiled and patted his shoulder: "Don't worry, I know what to do."

Before long, the carriage arrived at Shoukang Palace. The palace was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers, a festive atmosphere prevailing. The gate was filled with princes, nobles, and court officials come to pay birthday respects, each wearing formal attire with festive smiles on their faces. When the Empress Dowager's personal maid saw the Crown Prince and Zhu Changlan arrive, she quickly stepped forward, bowed respectfully, and said: "Greetings to the Crown Prince and Ninth Prince. The Empress Dowager is already waiting in the main hall and has asked this slave to escort Your Highnesses inside."

The two followed the maid into the main hall of Shoukang Palace, which was already full of people. On the throne at the head of the hall sat a dignified old woman——the current Empress Dowager. She was wearing a deep red brocade robe with intricate phoenix patterns, adorned with gold hairpins and jewels, her eyes sharp. Beside her sat the Emperor, his face majestic, his expression calm, revealing little emotion. On the Emperor's other side sat Consort Zheng, wearing a phoenix robe, her makeup exquisite, with an appropriate smile on her lips, but her eyes silently sizing up everyone in the hall.

"Your son (Your brother) greets Father Emperor, Mother Empress, and Empress Dowager. May your fortune be as boundless as the East Sea and your longevity surpass the South Mountain." The Crown Prince and Zhu Changlan bowed together.

"Rise." The Empress Dowager's voice was somewhat aged but still full of energy. She nodded at the Crown Prince, but when her gaze fell on Zhu Changlan, it carried a faint distance. "Ninth Prince, rise as well. It's been a long time, you've grown more spirited."

"Thank you for your praise, Empress Dowager." Zhu Changlan replied softly, his tone respectful but neither humble nor arrogant.

The two sat in their designated seats. Zhu Changlan's seat was right beside the Crown Prince, just close enough to feel the Crown Prince's steady aura. He glanced around the hall and saw Third Prince Zhu Changxun sitting beside Consort Zheng, wearing a purple brocade robe, handsome in appearance but with an ostentatious air. He felt Zhu Changlan's gaze, looked over, a flash of contempt in his eyes, then put on a fake smile and nodded at Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan looked away, sneering inwardly. He naturally knew of Zhu Changxun's hostility towards him——it was only because the Crown Prince favored him. He didn't bother to argue with Zhu Changxun, just sat quietly, listening to the birthday wishes from everyone in the hall, while keeping an eye on the movements in the hall.

After the birthday banquet officially began, palace maids brought in exquisite dishes one by one, filling the tables. The dishes were extremely abundant, with delicacies from land and sea, rare meats, each as exquisite as a work of art. Melodious music filled the hall, and a group of dancers in gorgeous costumes danced gracefully in the center, their beautiful movements drawing waves of admiration from the crowd.

However, beneath this festive and harmonious atmosphere, an undercurrent was surging. Zhu Changlan acutely sensed that many officials' gazes in the hall were secretly exchanging glances, either toward the Crown Prince or toward Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, their eyes filled with probing and scheming. Consort Zheng occasionally whispered to the officials beside her, a secretive smile on her lips, plotting something.

"Ninth Brother, try this lotus chicken, it's the signature dish of the Shoukang Palace kitchen, it tastes good." The Crown Prince placed a piece of chicken in Zhu Changlan's bowl and said softly, breaking his thoughts.

Zhu Changlan came back to his senses, nodded, picked up his chopsticks, and took a bite. The chicken was tender and smooth, with an excellent texture, truly delicious. He smiled at the Crown Prince: "Thank you, Imperial Brother, it tastes very good."

Just then, Third Prince Zhu Changxun stood up holding a wine cup and said to the Crown Prince and Zhu Changlan: "Imperial Brother, Ninth Brother, today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, such a joyous day, let me offer you a toast." His tone seemed respectful, but his eyes carried a hint of provocation.

The Crown Prince picked up his wine cup and said calmly: "Third Brother, it's kind of you."

Zhu Changlan also picked up his wine cup, but just as he was about to raise it, he suddenly frowned slightly. He keenly detected an extremely faint and unusual aura coming from Zhu Changxun——the aura was cold and obscure, completely different from human aura, carrying a demonic feeling. This aura was very faint, almost imperceptible. If he hadn't cultivated for many years and was extremely sensitive to demon aura, he wouldn't have noticed it at all.

Zhu Changlan's heart skipped a beat: Could Zhu Changxun be related to the demon clan? Or was there a demon person beside him? He silently observed Zhu Changxun, who had a ruddy complexion and a smug smile, looking no different from an ordinary person, with no demon aura revealing itself. Could he have felt it wrong?

"Ninth Brother, why aren't you drinking? Are you not giving me face?" When Zhu Changlan didn't raise his cup for a long time, Zhu Changxun's tone carried a hint of dissatisfaction, and his voice rose a little, causing many people in the hall to turn to look.

The Crown Prince noticed Zhu Changlan's unusualness, frowned slightly, and said to Zhu Changxun: "Third Brother, Ninth Brother hasn't been feeling well lately and shouldn't drink alcohol. I'll drink this cup for him." With that, he reached for Zhu Changlan's wine cup.

"Imperial Brother, that's not acceptable." Zhu Changxun stopped the Crown Prince, his tone aggressive. "Today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, a day of celebration for all. Even if Ninth Brother isn't feeling well, he should still toast the Empress Dowager as a token of respect. If he refuses to drink even a cup of wine, isn't that disrespectful to the Empress Dowager?"

As soon as these words were spoken, the atmosphere in the hall instantly became tense. The Empress Dowager's face darkened slightly, her gaze falling on Zhu Changlan with scrutiny. Consort Zheng added fuel to the fire from the side: "Yes, Ninth Prince, today is the Empress Dowager's birthday, you should indeed toast the Empress Dowager. If you're not feeling well, just drink a little less."

Zhu Changlan understood——Zhu Changxun was deliberately targeting him, wanting to embarrass him in front of everyone. He suppressed his doubts, picked up his wine cup, bowed to the Empress Dowager, and said: "Empress Dowager, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I haven't been feeling well lately. Today, on your birthday, I would like to offer tea instead of wine, wishing you longevity, fortune, and health."

"Tea instead of wine?" Zhu Changxun sneered. "Ninth Brother, that's too insincere, isn't it? Could a cup of wine really hurt you? Or do you simply not take the Empress Dowager seriously?"

Just then, Zhu Changlan once again detected that cold demon aura, this time clearer, and it didn't come from Zhu Changxun himself, but from a personal eunuch behind him. That eunuch kept his head down, standing respectfully behind Zhu Changxun, looking extremely inconspicuous, but Zhu Changlan could feel that the demon aura was emanating from him.

Zhu Changlan suddenly understood——it was Zhu Changxun's personal eunuch who was from the demon clan. No wonder Zhu Changxun had been acting more and more ostentatious lately, he must have demons secretly helping him. He silently looked away, knowing this wasn't the time to expose this matter. If he rashly spoke about the demon aura, it would only cause panic, and Consort Zheng might even turn around and bite back, accusing him of spreading rumors to deceive people.

"Third Brother, don't speak nonsense." The Crown Prince's tone became serious, carrying authority. "Ninth Brother has been unwell, and I've known about it for a long time. Offering tea instead of wine is a token of goodwill. The Empress Dowager is benevolent and won't blame him."

The Empress Dowager's expression softened slightly. She looked at the Crown Prince, then at Zhu Changlan, and slowly said: "Alright, Ninth Prince isn't feeling well, so don't force him. I appreciate the gesture of offering tea instead of wine." Although she favored Zhu Changxun, she knew the Crown Prince's weight and didn't want to escalate the situation on her birthday.

Seeing the Empress Dowager speak, Zhu Changxun reluctantly backed down, but still gave Zhu Changlan an unwilling glare before resentfully returning to his seat. The atmosphere in the hall relaxed slightly, and the music resumed, with the dancers continuing to dance, as if the episode had never happened.

But Zhu Changlan's heart could not calm down. The appearance of this demon aura made him realize that in this deep palace, there were not only human power struggles but also hidden demon forces. The demon clan had always been hostile to humans, and now someone had infiltrated the palace, attaching themselves to Zhu Changxun. He didn't know what their plans were. If left unchecked, it would not only threaten the Crown Prince's safety but might even shake the foundation of the Ming Dynasty under the Wanli Emperor.

He glanced quietly at the Crown Prince, who was holding a wine cup and talking to the officials beside him, his expression calm, seemingly unaware of the anomaly. Zhu Changlan knew the Crown Prince was an ordinary human and couldn't detect the demon aura. He had to find a way to inform the Crown Prince of this matter as soon as possible without revealing his own identity.

The banquet continued, but Zhu Changlan lost his appetite for food and had no mood to enjoy the singing and dancing, his mind always occupied with the demon aura. He occasionally looked at the eunuch behind Zhu Changxun, carefully observing his every move. The eunuch always kept his head down, standing respectfully behind Zhu Changxun, occasionally refilling his wine or serving dishes, his movements skillful, no different from ordinary eunuchs. But Zhu Changlan could feel that although the demon aura on him was deliberately suppressed, it was still slowly flowing.

Near the end of the banquet, the eunuch quietly left the hall under the pretext of going to the changing room. Zhu Changlan's heart moved, and he said softly to the Crown Prince: "Imperial Brother, I need to go to the restroom."

The Crown Prince nodded and warned: "Be careful, go and come back quickly."

Zhu Changlan stood up and quietly followed him. Following the guidance of the demon aura, he went all the way to the secluded corridor on the west side of Shoukang Palace. At this time, the corridor was empty, with only the sound of the evening wind blowing through the corridor pillars. The eunuch was standing at the corner of the corridor, with his back to him, seemingly talking to someone.

"I've completed the task the master assigned. Zhu Changxun now fully trusts me, and I'll be able to keep the Crown Prince in check according to the master's plan in the future." The eunuch's voice was no longer the high-pitched tone of ordinary eunuchs, but deep and hoarse, with a demonic quality.

Zhu Changlan held his breath, hiding behind a corridor pillar, listening quietly. He could feel that besides this eunuch's demon aura, there was another even more powerful demon aura lingering not far away——obviously his "master."

"Well done." A cold voice came from the darkness. "Remember, don't reveal your identity. When the time is right, we'll seize the Ming Dynasty's throne in one fell swoop, making humans our slaves. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo is the biggest obstacle. You need to find a way to sow discord between him and the Emperor and Empress Dowager as soon as possible, preferably discrediting him. As for Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan, the Crown Prince favors him greatly. If you get the chance, eliminate him, cutting off the Crown Prince's right-hand man."

"This subordinate understands." The eunuch said respectfully.

Zhu Changlan's heart sank: He never expected the demons to have such ambition, wanting to seize the Ming Dynasty's throne. Moreover, their targets were not only the Crown Prince but also him. He tightened his grip on the dagger at his waist, his fingertips slightly exerting force, silently resolving to stop their plot.

Just then, that powerful demon aura suddenly surged towards his direction, clearly detecting his presence. "Who's there?" The cold voice sounded, filled with vigilance.

Zhu Changlan knew he had been exposed, so he no longer hid, stepping out from behind the pillar, looking coldly at the eunuch and the figure in the darkness. "Demon scum, how dare you infiltrate the palace and plot evil!"

The eunuch turned around, a sinister grin on his face. His originally ordinary face gradually twisted, his eyes glowed green, and the demon aura on his body was no longer suppressed, becoming extremely strong. "I didn't expect you to discover us. Since that's the case, you can stay here forever!" With that, he pounced towards Zhu Changlan, his hands turning into sharp claws, carrying a sharp cold wind.

Zhu Changlan was prepared, sidestepping his attack while drawing the golden nanmu dagger from his waist. The dagger glinted coldly in the moonlight, and the warm jade's gentle spiritual energy merged with the spiritual energy within his body, spreading along the dagger to form a faint halo. This dagger was forged from western region refined iron, capable of suppressing evil demons, a powerful weapon against the demon clan.

"Do you think you can hurt me?" Zhu Changlan snorted coldly, holding the dagger, took the initiative to attack the eunuch. His movements were light and fluid, enhanced by spiritual energy, every swing extremely precise. The dagger clashed with the eunuch's claws, making a "ding" sound, sparks flying.

The eunuch clearly didn't expect Zhu Changlan to have such strength, a flash of surprise in his eyes, which then became more ferocious. "You're not an ordinary human? Are you also from the demon clan?"

"What I am, you don't need to know." Zhu Changlan's tone was cold, his attacks becoming more fierce. The spiritual energy within his body continuously flowed into the dagger, making its light grow brighter. Every attack carried the power to suppress evil demons, making the eunuch struggle to keep up.

The demon aura in the darkness was also restless, seemingly wanting to help, but hesitated. Clearly, he didn't dare to reveal himself in the palace, for fear of causing a bigger commotion.

"Since you won't say, then die!" The eunuch roared, his demon power surging, a faint black aura surrounding him, pouncing towards Zhu Changlan again.

Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, no longer holding back, channeling all his spiritual energy into the dagger. The dagger instantly burst into bright white light. He faced the eunuch's attack and stabbed fiercely. With a soft "thud", the dagger precisely pierced the eunuch's heart.

The eunuch's body stiffened, the green glow in his eyes gradually fading, the black aura on his body dissipating, returning to his ordinary eunuch appearance, falling to the ground, no longer breathing. That faint demon aura also completely disappeared.

The demon aura in the darkness let out an angry roar when it sensed its companion had been killed, but still didn't dare to show itself, only left unwillingly. Zhu Changlan could feel that demon aura was quickly receding, clearly afraid of being chased.

Zhu Changlan sheathed the dagger, took a breath. Although the fight was short, it consumed a lot of his spiritual energy. He glanced at the eunuch's body on the ground, knowing this was not a place to stay long, so he quickly left the corridor and returned to the Shoukang Palace main hall.

By this time, the banquet was drawing to a close, and everyone was preparing to leave. When the Crown Prince saw Zhu Changlan return, he quickly asked: "Ninth Brother, why did you take so long? Are you okay?"

"I'm fine, just ran into a little trouble on the way, was delayed for a moment." Zhu Changlan said softly, not immediately telling the Crown Prince about the demon clan matter, fearing it would cause panic in the hall or be heard by people with malicious intentions.

The Crown Prince saw he looked normal, so he relaxed. The two followed everyone in bidding farewell to the Empress Dowager, Emperor, and Consort Zheng, then left Shoukang Palace together and took a carriage back to the Eastern Palace.

After the carriage pulled away from Shoukang Palace, Zhu Changlan slowly relaxed. He looked at the Crown Prince and said seriously: "Imperial Brother, I discovered a major event at today's banquet."

The Crown Prince saw his grave expression and knew the matter was not simple, so he quickly asked: "Ninth Brother, what's wrong?"

"One of Zhu Changxun's personal eunuchs is from the demon clan." Zhu Changlan lowered his voice and said, "Moreover, he has a more powerful demon master behind him. Their goal is to seize the Ming Dynasty's throne and deal with you and me."

Upon hearing this, the Crown Prince's face instantly became serious. Although he didn't believe in ghosts and gods, he knew Zhu Changlan wouldn't lie to him, and given Zhu Changlan's special identity, it wasn't surprising that he could detect these things. "Is this true?"

"Absolutely true." Zhu Changlan nodded, telling the Crown Prince in detail about the conversation he had heard in the corridor and the fight that followed. "I've already killed that demon eunuch, and his master has escaped. But I'm certain there must be other demons lurking in the palace. We need to find a way to deal with this as soon as possible."

The Crown Prince was silent for a moment, frowning deeply, his thoughts racing. Demons infiltrating the palace and plotting evil was no small matter. If not handled properly, it would not only cause turmoil in the court and among the people but might even endanger the country. He looked at Zhu Changlan and said firmly: "Ninth Brother, you did well. This matter is of great importance and should not be made public. We'll carefully discuss countermeasures after returning to the Eastern Palace. Don't worry, with me here, I will keep you safe and protect the Ming Dynasty."

Looking at the Crown Prince's firm gaze, warmth filled Zhu Changlan's heart. With such an elder brother, with the dagger in his hand, and with the warmth in his heart, he could bravely face all storms. The carriage slowly drove along the palace road, the moonlight casting a soft light on the carriage. The undercurrents of the palace banquet had not yet calmed, and the appearance of the demon aura added a bit more danger to this deep palace. The road ahead was destined to be uneven, but Zhu Changlan felt no fear in his heart, because he was no longer alone. With this elder brother, this dagger, and this warmth, he could bravely face all challenges.
