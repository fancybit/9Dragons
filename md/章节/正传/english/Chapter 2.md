# Chapter 2: A Touch of Warmth in the East Palace

The 25th year of the Wanli era in the Ming Dynasty, late spring.

The morning light in the side hall of Xian'an Palace was always softer and more gradual than elsewhere, perhaps due to the shelter of the corner of the palace walls on the west side of the inner court, or the挽留 of several osmanthus trees in the courtyard. When the sun climbed over the palace walls, it never seemed as urgent as in other places. Xian'an Palace, located on the west side of the inner court, was specially arranged for Zhu Changlan by the Empress. Though not as spacious as the East Palace, it was exquisitely laid out: behind the main hall were two side halls, east and west. The east side hall served as Zhu Changlan's bedroom, while the west side hall was used as a study and alchemical room. The courtyard was small but planted with several hundred-year-old osmanthus trees, personally planted by the Empress, now standing tall with spreading canopies. The newly sprouted branches carried a tender yellow hue, dotted with a few small new leaves, exuding vibrant vitality. There was also an ancient well in the east of the courtyard, with clear and sweet well water, which Zhu Changlan often used to brew osmanthus wine. On the west side were several magnolia trees, their branches full of flowers in spring, their fragrance filling the air. Warmth,裹挟着 the scent of plants, followed the wind's trajectory, quietly slipping through the window lattice of the east chamber, falling on the windowsill covered with plain brocade, making the small asparagus fern in the flowerpot on the windowsill even more verdant. Swallows under the eaves returned with spring mud in their beaks, perching on the carved corridor pillars, their chirping sounds clear and melodious, like a string of broken jade falling into the silent courtyard—first a few scattered calls, gradually gathering into a chorus, finally waking the sleeping person on the bed from light dreams. In the corner of the courtyard, a few sparrows hopped around, pecking at the leftover grains from yesterday, occasionally chirping softly, their songs interweaving with the swallows' to form the unique quiet symphony of Xian'an Palace in the early morning.

Zhu Changlan rolled over, the brocade quilt slipping half off his shoulders, revealing the moon-white underrobe beneath. The collar of the underrobe was embroidered with a circle of extremely light silver cloud patterns, the stitches so fine they were almost invisible, the threadwork flowing naturally—embroidered by the finest embroideress in the East Palace. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo always knew he disliked ostentation, even having the patterns on his intimate clothing specially ordered to be so understated, neither losing the status of a prince nor appearing ostentatious. His fingers curled unconsciously for a moment, nails round and plump, with a healthy pink color, then slowly relaxed, the pads of his fingers caressing the plain mattress beneath him, the texture delicate and soft, carrying the lingering warmth of sunlight. This mattress was woven from the finest tribute cotton from the south of the Yangtze River, the cotton thread thin and uniform, the fabric dense yet not heavy, with a small amount of silk mixed in, the touch as温润 as clouds,格外 comfortable against the skin. Last winter, the side hall of Xian'an Palace was exceptionally cold, even though the window cracks had been sealed with cotton paper, cold wind still seeped in. At night, even wrapped in thick quilts, he always felt the chill seeping into his bones. When the Crown Prince learned of this, without a word, he had three of the thickest tribute cotton mattresses from the East Palace warehouse sent over overnight, personally instructing Xiaoluzi: "Ninth Brother has a cold constitution; you must make sure he uses thick bedding, and add a layer of felt under the bed to keep him from freezing."

When the Empress learned of this, she also specially sent a silk quilt made from silk tribute from the south of the Yangtze River, the quilt cover embroidered with exquisite cloud patterns, sewn by the embroideress from the Empress's palace, the stitches fine, and the warmth excellent. Zhu Changlan always disliked extravagance, but he couldn't bear to辜负 the Empress and Crown Prince's heartfelt kindness, so he spread the silk quilt on the top layer, and every night he could feel that faint warmth, as if the Empress and Crown Prince were by his side. He turned over, his gaze falling on the small cabinet inside the bed, on which there was a small brocade box containing not only the note the Crown Prince had written to him last year, but also a sachet personally sewn by the Empress, filled with calming herbs, specially made by the Empress after learning he had trouble sleeping.

"My Prince, are you awake?"

Xiaoluzi's voice was as light as a wisp of smoke, coming through the curtain embroidered with intertwined lotus patterns, carrying a cautious tentative tone. Having grown up beside Zhu Changlan, he knew his prince's habits best, knowing that Zhu Changlan was a light sleeper and most disliked noise in the early morning, even deliberately lightening his steps, his boots barely making a sound on the ground. "His Royal Highness the Crown Prince sent breakfast early in the morning, saying it was freshly baked crab meat soup dumplings, and your favorite almond tofu, kept warm in the food box. His Highness specially instructed to serve it only after you wake up, ensuring you can eat it hot."

As Xiaoluzi spoke, he gently lifted a corner of the curtain, revealing a simple and honest face, his eyes full of concern. Seeing Zhu Changlan awake, a relieved smile appeared on his face. Behind him was a young palace maid, carrying a basin of warm water for Zhu Changlan to wash, the water temperature also specially adjusted, neither cold nor hot, just right.

Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, his eyes still hazy from just waking up, like a layer of thin mist covering them. He blinked, his long eyelashes fluttering gently, as light as butterfly wings, and after a moment, the haze in his eyes gradually dissipated. His gaze fell on the intertwined lotus patterns embroidered on the canopy, the patterns complex and exquisite, every stitch showing craftsmanship—this canopy was also a gift from the Crown Prince. On the plain brocade, there were subtly embroidered several swimming fish, each in a different posture: some flicking their tails, some blowing bubbles, vivid and lifelike. It was when he first entered the palace, following the Crown Prince to feed fish by the lake in the Imperial Garden, that he casually mentioned, "I like the carefree fish in the water." He never expected the Crown Prince to remember, and a few days later, he sent this canopy, smiling and saying, "Let these fish accompany you, so you can sleep as carefree as them."

His nose twitched slightly, as if already smelling the unique fresh fragrance of the crab meat soup dumplings, which were the signature dim sum of the East Palace kitchen and one of the few meat dishes he could accept. The head chef of the East Palace kitchen was specially invited by the Crown Prince from the south of the Yangtze River, best at making such delicate dim sum. The crab meat soup dumplings had skins as thin as cicada wings, almost transparent, revealing the filling inside. When you bit into them, the soup burst forth, fresh but not greasy, each bite unforgettable. He slowly sat up, and Xiaoluzi quickly stepped forward, draping a thin blanket over his shoulders, whispering, "My Prince has just woken up; be careful not to catch a cold."

"Bring it in."

His tone still carried the softness of just waking up, the end of his voice slightly rising, like a cat's soft hum after stretching, with an unconscious coquettishness.

Xiaoluzi responded and withdrew, returning shortly with two young eunuchs from the East Palace, their steps extremely light. The leading eunuch, named Xiaoxizi, was the most capable attendant beside the Crown Prince, having followed him for over ten years, capable and thoughtful, always with a gentle smile, making him look exceptionally approachable. His bow was standard but not stiff, his waist bent just right, his voice also perfectly measured, both respectful and gentle: "Greetings to the Ninth Prince. His Royal Highness said he knows you are always fond of sleeping in, so he specially had the kitchen keep the breakfast warm, so you can eat it hot when you wake up, lest cold food hurt your stomach."

The eunuch behind him was carrying a red lacquer food box with gold patterns, the handle wrapped in green satin embroidered with small cloud patterns, appearing extremely elegant. The food box was made with high-quality red lacquer, the surface as smooth as a mirror, clearly reflecting people's shadows, with gold thread tracing intertwined lotus patterns on the box body, the gold thread and red lacquer complementing each other, exuding nobility without ostentation. Xiaoxizi signaled the eunuch behind him to place the food box on the square table by the window, his movements gentle, afraid of making a sound to disturb Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan sat up, and Xiaoluzi quickly stepped forward to dress him. First, he removed the underrobe, replacing it with a light blue jacket made of soft silk, comfortable and lightweight to wear, then put on the dark blue brocade robe. Xiaoluzi's movements were skilled; when tying the jade belt, his fingers nimbly threaded through, tying it to just the right tightness, neither too tight to be uncomfortable nor too loose to slip. Zhu Changlan's gaze fell on the red lacquer food box with gold patterns, watching Xiaoxizi direct people to arrange it properly, a touch of warmth flashing in his eyes—this food box was specially customized by the Crown Prince, divided into three layers, each layer padded with thick cotton pads made from a mixture of silk and cotton, with excellent insulation. Even if left for an hour, the food inside would remain warm. On the side of the food box was carved a lazy cat, squinting in the sun, its whiskers clearly visible, its expression exactly like Zhu Changlan when he sunbathed, obviously the Crown Prince had specially instructed the craftsman to carve it after his likeness. He still remembered when the food box was delivered, the Crown Prince had laughed and said, "Ninth Brother, you are as lazy as this cat on weekdays; carving it on the food box to accompany you while eating is quite fitting."

He had blushed at the time, gently punching the Crown Prince, and now thinking about it, he still felt warm.

"Did the Crown Prince have court this morning?"

As Zhu Changlan allowed Xiaoluzi to tie the jade belt of his brocade robe, he casually asked, his tone carrying an unintentional concern. This dark blue brocade robe he was wearing was also a gift from the Crown Prince last year, made of the finest tribute brocade from the south of the Yangtze River, the texture as soft as spring water, smooth to the touch, the color calm yet not dull, shimmering faintly in the morning light. The cuffs and collar were embroidered with extremely light hidden patterns, simple cloud designs, almost imperceptible unless closely examined, perfectly suited to his dislike of ostentation. As the crown prince, the Crown Prince had numerous affairs to handle daily, court audiences being essential, often having to get up before dawn, so busy he rarely had time for a proper breakfast. Every time he thought of this, he couldn't help but feel a little心疼, always wanting to do something for the Crown Prince, yet knowing he couldn't help much, he could only silently keep him in mind.

"Returning to Your Highness, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince went to court early in the morning."

Xiaoxizi replied with a smile, quickly opening the food box. "Before leaving, he specially instructed this servant to tell you that after finishing breakfast, if you have time, you should come to the East Palace. He said he found something good to show you, and that you would definitely like it."

Zhu Changlan raised an eyebrow, a genuine curiosity flashing in his eyes, like a child hearing an interesting story. The Crown Prince always knew his preferences, never giving him flashy things like gold and silver or rare treasures, and every time he said "something good," it always precisely hit his heart. He carefully recalled: the Crown Prince had given him many things, each carrying the Crown Prince's heartfelt intention—either a piece of warm boxwood suitable for a brush holder, with clear grain and delicate texture, which he still used, reluctant to replace; or a rare poetry collection, its pages yellowed but well-preserved, with previous annotations, making him cherish it; or a delicately crafted round fan with a comfortable handle, the fan ribs made of high-quality sandalwood, the fan surface painted with ink bamboo by the Crown Prince himself, full of character. Last time, the Crown Prince gave him a piece of jet-black jade from Kunlun Mountain, the entire stone pitch-black, cool to the touch, with a faint fragrance that could calm the mind. At that time, he was encountering a bottleneck in his cultivation and always slept restlessly at night. After obtaining this jet-black jade, he kept it by his pillow and indeed slept much more peacefully. Thinking of this, he became even more curious, wondering what surprise the Crown Prince had prepared for him this time.

After washing, he walked to the table and sat down. Xiaoxizi had already quickly arranged everything from the food box, his movements gentle, afraid of damaging the food inside. The first layer was a bamboo steamer of crab meat soup dumplings, still emitting a faint white steam, the fresh fragrance wafting over, making one's mouth water. The dumplings were plump, like small white jade balls, the skin as thin as paper, clearly showing the pale yellow crab meat and pink shrimp inside. The second layer was a small bowl of almond tofu, served in an exquisite white porcelain bowl, the color milky white, as delicate as congealed fat, sprinkled with a few crushed almonds and a little honey, the sweet aroma of honey intermingling with the fragrant scent of almonds, sweet and inviting. The third layer was a plate of exquisite crystal shrimp dumplings, translucent like small transparent lanterns, faintly revealing the pink shrimp inside, the shrimp meat full and firm, accompanied by a small dish of dipping sauce made from aged vinegar and ginger, the sour aroma of the vinegar just enough to cut through the greasiness, while the ginger could remove the coldness of the shrimp. In addition, there was a small plate of refreshing cold cucumber in the food box, the cucumber crisp and tender, drizzled with a little sesame oil and soy sauce, used to whet the appetite, clearly specially ordered by the Crown Prince, knowing he would feel greasy after eating too much meat.

"Please try them, Your Highness. These dumplings were just wrapped at the卯 hour this morning, the crab meat from fresh hairy crabs delivered from Taihu Lake yesterday. Each crab was selected for its plump roe and meat, yielding a full small bowl of crab meat."

Xiaoxizi said殷勤地, his tone carrying a hint of pride, as if he had made the dumplings himself. "His Royal Highness specially instructed the kitchen to put less ginger in the crab meat, lest it overpower the taste of the crab, so you won't find it spicy. His Highness also said your stomach is not good; although the dumplings are delicious, you shouldn't eat too many. He told you to eat two to pad your stomach first, then try the almond tofu, which is gentle and nourishing for the stomach."

As Xiaoxizi spoke, he picked up a pair of clean chopsticks and handed them to Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of respect. Having followed the Crown Prince for many years, he knew how much the Crown Prince valued this Ninth Prince, and how much this Ninth Prince meant to the Crown Prince, so he naturally didn't dare to neglect him in the slightest.

Zhu Changlan took the chopsticks, which were made of ivory, warm to the touch, with just the right weight, neither heavy nor light, feeling excellent in the hand—also a gift from the Crown Prince. He gently picked up a dumpling; the skin was extremely thin, almost breaking at the touch. He carefully held it, afraid of breaking the skin and letting the soup leak out, which would be a waste. He took a small bite, and the scalding soup instantly burst on his tongue, the fresh crab meat mixed with sweet broth, rich yet not greasy at all. The fragrance of the crab meat filled his mouth, lingering for a long time. The ginger taste was so faint it was almost imperceptible, just enough to counteract the coldness of the crab without overpowering the crab's own flavor, the seasoning just right. He narrowed his eyes, revealing a satisfied expression, exactly like a cat enjoying delicious food, his long eyelashes fluttering gently with a hint of contentment, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, his eyes full of smiles. "Delicious."

He couldn't help but whisper, his voice carrying sincere praise. He picked up another one, this time taking a big bite, and the soup trickled down the corner of his mouth. Xiaoluzi quickly handed over a clean brocade handkerchief, and Zhu Changlan took it, gently wiping the corner of his mouth, a slight embarrassed blush on his face, like a child caught stealing.

"The craftsmanship at the East Palace is still authentic."

He said with a smile, his voice full of sincere praise, picking up another one and slowly savoring it. The dumpling skin was thin but resilient, wrapping the full filling, every bite combining the sweetness of the crab meat and the fragrance of the dough, perfectly matched.

Xiaoluzi poured him a cup of warm water, whispering, "My Prince, eat slowly, don't burn yourself."

Zhu Changlan nodded, taking a sip of warm water, which slid down his throat, warm and comfortable, just relieving the heat from the dumplings. He put down the chopsticks, picked up the jade spoon beside him, and scooped a spoonful of almond tofu into his mouth. The almond tofu was as delicate as clouds, melting instantly, without the slightest graininess, sweet but not cloying, with a faint almond aroma, perfectly neutralizing the salty freshness of the dumplings. This almond tofu was also his favorite; the Crown Prince knew he was afraid of bitterness, so every time he had people grind the almonds extremely fine, and specially added more honey and milk to completely mask the bitterness of the almonds, making it exceptionally温润. He remembered once, when he was ill in bed, his appetite was extremely poor, and he couldn't eat anything. When the Crown Prince learned of this, he personally stayed by his bed, having people boil bowl after bowl of almond tofu until he was willing to eat. Since then, this almond tofu became his most trusted food when he was ill. He ate slowly, savoring each bite, a relaxed smile on his face, as if this simple breakfast was the most precious delicacy in the world. After eating two dumplings and a small半碗 of almond tofu, he picked up a crystal shrimp dumpling, dipped it in some sauce. The fresh aroma of the shrimp combined with the sour aroma of the sauce, the taste rich, unforgettable. Xiaoxizi watched him eat happily, a smile also appearing on his face.

After breakfast, Zhu Changlan felt warm all over, so he went to the courtyard and sat on the rosewood reclining chair to sunbathe. This reclining chair was his favorite, also a gift from the Crown Prince. The wood was specially transported from the south by the Crown Prince, air-dried for three years, then carefully carved by the best carpenter in the capital, taking a lot of effort. The armrests of the chair were carved with intertwined lotus patterns, the lines flowing naturally, fitting the curve of the palm perfectly, comfortable to hold, and the seat was polished smooth without any rough spots. He gently leaned back, his body completely relaxed, the curve of the chair fitting his figure perfectly, extremely comfortable. Covered with a plain soft silk blanket woven with silk by the Crown Prince's order, thin but warm, the sunlight shining on his body, covered with this blanket, he felt warm all over, almost falling asleep. The osmanthus trees in the courtyard swayed in the wind, the new leaves glowing faintly green in the sunlight, the light and shadow falling on him in a patchwork pattern, like a flowing ink painting. A few butterflies fluttered in the courtyard, landing on the blooming flowers, adding a touch of vitality.

Xiaoluzi carried a tea set over, placing it on the stone table beside the reclining chair, then began making tea. He was making Lapsang Souchong, using the first bucket of water drawn from the old well in the Imperial Garden early in the morning—clear and sweet, perfect for making tea. Xiaoluzi first scalded the teapot and cups with hot water, then added an appropriate amount of tea leaves, which were tightly rolled, black and shiny, top-quality Lapsang Souchong. He lifted the kettle, the water just boiled, pouring slowly along the edge of the purple clay teapot, the water flow delicate like a small silver thread. The tea leaves slowly unfolded in the pot, releasing a rich aroma, with a unique pine smoke scent and caramel sweetness, filling the entire courtyard. "My Prince, please try the freshly brewed tea. It's new tea His Royal Highness sent a few days ago, said to be this year's first spring tea, more mellow than last year's."

As Xiaoluzi spoke, he poured the brewed tea into the cup. The tea was orange-red, clear and bright, making one want to drink it. He handed the cup to Zhu Changlan, his movements gentle, afraid of burning him.

Zhu Changlan took the tea cup, his fingertips touching the warm purple clay cup wall, a warmth spreading from his fingertips, his heart warming. This purple clay teapot was his treasure, also an old item found by the Crown Prince, said to be made by a famous craftsman of the previous dynasty, the pot body carved with simple landscape patterns, simple and elegant, with excellent air permeability, able to maximize the mellow aftertaste of Lapsang Souchong. He gently swirled the cup, the tea swirling inside, the aroma becoming more intense. Taking a small sip, the tea slid down his throat, with a unique pine smoke scent and caramel sweetness, rich and mellow, with a long aftertaste lingering in his mouth, making him feel refreshed. "It's indeed good, smoother and more mellow than last year's."

He said with a smile, his eyes full of satisfaction. He had always loved drinking Lapsang Souchong and was extremely挑剔 about the quality of the tea. The new tea the Crown Prince sent was clearly carefully selected, perfectly matching his taste. Xiaoluzi smiled upon hearing this, saying, "His Highness knows you love this, so he specially sent someone to Wuyi Mountain, buying from the most famous tea mountain, and personally tasted it after returning, confirming it suits your taste before sending it over."

The Crown Prince knew he loved this tea, and every year he would have the best tea bought from Wuyi Mountain, carefully packaged and sent over. The boxes used to package the tea were also specially customized, wooden boxes lined with moisture-proof cotton paper, which could well preserve the aroma and quality of the tea. Every time tea was sent, the Crown Prince would also include a note, written on rice paper with the Crown Prince's strong and powerful handwriting, detailing the tea-making precautions: "The water temperature should be just boiling, pour slowly, steep for the time of an incense stick, not too long, to avoid bitterness."

In addition, the Crown Prince would also write a few words of advice on the note, sometimes "It's cold, drink tea to warm up," sometimes "It's rainy these days, remember to add clothes," just a few words but full of concern. Zhu Changlan carefully kept all these notes in an exquisite wooden box, taking them out to look at in his free time, which would make him feel warm. The Crown Prince was busy with state affairs, yet still remembered these trivial details—this heartfelt intention made him especially cherish.

After sunbathing for a while, Zhu Changlan felt warm all over, and his heart was also thinking about the "good thing" the Crown Prince mentioned, so he got up and said, "Xiaoluzi, prepare the carriage, I'm going to the East Palace."

Xiaoluzi quickly responded, turning to prepare the carriage. Zhu Changlan returned to the house, walking to the desk, picking up a round fan with chicken wing wood ribs. This fan was made by himself; the ribs were made of high-quality chicken wing wood, with clear grain like flowing water, carefully polished by him to a smooth and delicate touch. On the fan surface was a landscape painting in ink and wash he had painted himself: distant mountains like smoke, near water containing mist, a few small thatched cottages in the mountains, a winding path in front of the cottages, and a lazy cat lying on a rock sunbathing, its expression relaxed and carefree. The signature was "Xuan Yu," his courtesy name, the brushwork elegant and casual, with a touch of freedom. He painted such a picture because he had always yearned for such a relaxed and carefree life, far away from the disputes of the deep palace and the troubles of the world. He held the fan in his hand, fanning gently, the breeze carrying a faint woody fragrance, making him feel particularly refreshed. Then he went to the wardrobe, taking out a small jar of osmanthus wine from the drawer—this was brewed by him a few days ago, using the golden osmanthus collected last autumn. Last autumn, the osmanthus in Xian'an Palace bloomed particularly profusely, golden petals covering the courtyard, fragrance浓郁. He personally collected the petals, carefully selecting and removing impurities, then drying them, soaking them in his own brewed rice wine, sealed in a clay pot for half a year, the aroma becoming more mellow. The Crown Prince also loved this, but with many rules in the East Palace, it was inconvenient to drink too much. He thought of bringing it over, and the two of them could have a small drink in the side hall, which would be quite pleasant. He carefully tucked the osmanthus wine in his sleeve, afraid of spilling it.

Walking out of Xian'an Palace, the begonia flowers along the palace road were in full bloom, their pink and white petals layered like clouds piled on the branches. Some were fully open, revealing yellow stamens, while others were still in buds, like small lanterns, extremely cute. A breeze blew, petals falling like a pink flower rain, covering the bluestone road like a pink carpet, soft to step on, still carrying a faint floral scent. Zhu Changlan slowed his steps, watching the dancing petals, his eyes full of gentle smiles. He had always loved these flowers and plants, finding them pure and beautiful, unlike human hearts, which were complex. As long as you cared for them with your heart, they would reward you with their most beautiful姿态. Many palace maids and eunuchs passed by on the palace road, and upon seeing Zhu Changlan, they all stopped to bow respectfully, their tones respectful. Zhu Changlan smiled and nodded in response, not stopping his steps. He could feel that the palace maids and eunuchs looked at him with much more respect than before—all because of the Crown Prince. Without the Crown Prince's protection, he feared he would have suffered much bullying in the deep palace. Thinking of this, his gratitude for the Crown Prince deepened.

The carriage had long been waiting outside the palace gate, the body in a low-key dark brown, made of high-quality wood, carefully polished and lacquered, the surface as smooth as a mirror. The interior walls of the carriage were covered with soft brocade, the color a light elegant blue, embroidered with small orchid patterns, fresh and elegant. On the seat was a soft pillow embroidered with a cat, specially made by Zhu Changlan, filled with soft silk, extremely comfortable to lean on. He got into the carriage, leaning against the soft pillow, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. The carriage was filled with a faint sandalwood fragrance, specially placed by him to calm the mind. The carriage moved slowly, the body jolting slightly but not uncomfortably, instead like a gentle rocking, making him feel particularly relaxed. In his ears were the "creak" of wheels rolling over the bluestone road, the birdsong from outside the window, and the sound of petals falling—everything seemed particularly pleasant. With his eyes closed, he felt the carriage's jolts, unconsciously recalling the bits and pieces of his time with the Crown Prince, a gentle smile appearing on his face.

Before long, the carriage arrived at the East Palace. At the palace gate of the East Palace, Xiaoxizi was already waiting. Seeing Zhu Changlan's carriage, he quickly stepped forward and bowed, "Ninth Prince, His Royal Highness has already returned from court and is waiting for you in the study."

Zhu Changlan got off the carriage, following Xiaoxizi into the East Palace. The East Palace was much more spacious than Xian'an Palace, but without the coldness and alienation of the imperial palace, everywhere filled with warm烟火气—this was all because Crown Prince Zhu Changluo had always been gentle by nature, disliking those繁琐 formalities, and the layout of the East Palace was mostly according to his preferences. Under the corridor hung many red lanterns, the color bright red, embroidered with golden characters for good fortune, appearing particularly festive. The corridor pillars were wrapped with green vines, the leaves tender green and vibrant, winding up the pillars, decorating them particularly elegantly. In the courtyard was a small lotus pond, the water clear to the bottom, clearly showing the pebbles and small fish swimming at the bottom. By the pond were several willow trees, their branches long, hanging to the water. When the breeze blew, the willow branches swayed, their reflections in the water also moving, extremely elegant. On the stone table by the pond was a set of tea utensils made of white porcelain, painted with faint lotus patterns, clearly a place where the Crown Prince usually rested and enjoyed the scenery. In the courtyard were also many rare flowers and plants: peonies blooming luxuriantly, roses blooming brightly, orchids blooming elegantly, and many unnamed flowers competing to bloom, beautiful beyond compare, the air filled with a浓郁 floral fragrance.

"His Royal Highness knows you like wooden things, so he specially had the tables and chairs in the study replaced with red sandalwood, saying the texture is hard and the fragrance is mellow, which you will definitely like."

Xiaoxizi said with a smile as he walked, "Even the brush holders and paperweights in the study were made according to your preferences by His Highness, all simple but comfortable objects."

Zhu Changlan nodded, warmth welling up in his heart like a warm current slowly flowing through his limbs. The Crown Prince was always like this, remembering his preferences, even trivial matters, and doing them with care. He remembered when he first entered the palace through reincarnation, he was still young, only seven or eight years old, his biological mother had just passed away, his father paid no attention to him, placing him in the remote Xian'an Palace, almost forgetting his existence. The palace maids and eunuchs were all opportunists; seeing he was not favored, they neglected him in every way,克扣 his rations, not giving enough charcoal in winter, not giving cool fruits in summer, and even his clothes were changed only rarely, tattered and worn. Once, he saw other princes had exquisite toys and felt envious, casually mentioning to the eunuch taking care of him that he wanted a wooden rattle. He mentioned it several times, but no one took it to heart, and the eunuch even mocked him, "An unfavored prince still wants toys."

Somehow, this matter reached the Crown Prince's ears. At that time, the Crown Prince was only a teenager. Upon learning of this, he personally went to Xian'an Palace to see him, and seeing him wearing tattered clothes, his small face red from the cold, his heart ached. After returning, the Crown Prince personally made a rattle from peach wood for him. Although the craftsmanship was not exquisite and the drum body was a bit rough, it was the first sincere gift he had ever received. When the Crown Prince handed him the rattle, he smiled and said, "Ninth Brother, from now on, I'll protect you, and no one will dare to bully you."

From then on, the Crown Prince often came to see him, bringing him clothes, food, and toys, teaching him to read and write, and teaching him how to behave. It was because of the Crown Prince's protection that those eunuchs and palace maids no longer dared to neglect him, and his life gradually improved. That peach wood rattle, he kept it carefully, in a drawer close to his body. Even though the Crown Prince later gave him many more exquisite toys, he never discarded it.

Entering the study, a faint ink fragrance and sandalwood scent hit his face, making him feel peaceful. Crown Prince Zhu Changluo was sitting at the desk reviewing memorials, wearing a bright yellow daily robe made of high-quality silk, soft in texture and bright in color, a jade belt around his waist inlaid with a high-quality white jade, warm and translucent. His facial features were handsome: sword-like eyebrows, starry eyes, a high nose, thin lips, combining to make him exceptionally handsome. Between his eyebrows was a calm and dignified aura, developed from years of handling state affairs, yet without losing his gentleness. Sunlight poured through the window lattice onto him, coating him with a warm yellow halo, making him appear particularly温润.

He was holding a red brush, the tip dipped in cinnabar, annotating the memorials, his expression focused, his brow slightly furrowed, clearly encountering a difficult matter. Upon hearing footsteps, he looked up, and when he saw Zhu Changlan, a warm smile instantly appeared on his face, like spring breeze melting the ice on a lake, instantly dispelling the fatigue and seriousness between his eyebrows, the tiredness in his eyes also dissipating a lot: "Ninth Brother, you're finally here, please sit. Did you have a tiring journey?"

He put down the red brush in his hand, leaning forward slightly, his eyes full of concern.

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, bowing and saying, "Elder Brother."

"No need for formalities."

Zhu Changluo waved his hand, pointing to the red sandalwood chair opposite the desk, "Sit down. I just made some tea; it's still your favorite Lapsang Souchong."

Zhu Changlan sat down, picking up the tea cup on the table and taking a small sip. The tea temperature was just right, fragrant and mellow, exactly his favorite taste. "Elder Brother's tea is always brewed perfectly to my liking."

He said with a smile.

Zhu Changluo smiled, rubbing his temples with his hand, clearly tired from reviewing memorials all morning. "You like it, that's good." He paused, his gaze falling on Zhu Changlan, full of concern, carefully examining him as if to confirm he was well, "How has Xian'an Palace been lately? Has anyone neglected you? Are the rations delivered on time? Is there enough charcoal?"

The Crown Prince's一连串 questions made Zhu Changlan's heart warm, knowing that the Crown Prince had always been concerned about his daily life. As the crown prince, the Crown Prince had countless matters to handle every day, yet still found time to care about his daily life—this heartfelt intention made him especially moved.

"Everything is fine," Zhu Changlan said with a smile, sincerely, "Xiaoluzi takes good care of me, and the palace people don't dare to neglect me. The rations are delivered on time, even more abundant than before, and there's enough charcoal; I sleep warmly at night."

The Crown Prince had always worried he would be wronged in Xian'an Palace, often sending people to secretly take care of him, and specially instructed the Internal Affairs Bureau to take good care of his daily life. No matter how snobbish those eunuchs and palace maids were, they didn't dare to disobey the Crown Prince's orders, so naturally they didn't dare to really为难 him. Once, a newly arrived eunuch didn't know the depth, thinking he was not favored, deliberately delayed delivering his breakfast. When discovered by someone sent by the Crown Prince, the Crown Prince directly ordered the eunuch to be flogged twenty times, expelling him from the palace. From then on, the palace people were even more respectful to him, not daring to neglect him in the slightest. He looked at the Crown Prince, adding, "Elder Brother, don't worry, I'm living well in Xian'an Palace; you don't need to worry about me."

"That's good," Zhu Changluo nodded, a relieved expression on his face, "If anyone dares to bully you, just tell me, and I won't let them off lightly."

His tone was gentle, yet with undeniable firmness, like a reliable mountain, making people feel at ease.

After chatting for a few more words, Zhu Changlan couldn't help but ask, "Elder Brother called me here, saying there's something good to show me?"

There was a hint of expectation in his eyes, like a curious child.

Zhu Changluo smiled, a hint of mystery in his eyes, taking a delicate wooden box from the drawer of the desk. This wooden box was made of a whole piece of golden nanmu, without any excess decoration, polished to a smooth finish, shining with a faint luster, with only a small cat's paw print carved on the lid, small and cute, clearly specially designed for Zhu Changlan. The edge of the wooden box was inlaid with a thin circle of silver wire, the silver wire outlining simple patterns, both exquisite and simple. Zhu Changluo gently placed the wooden box on the table, pushing it in front of Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of expectation: "Open it and see if you like it."

Zhu Changlan had always liked wooden objects, especially golden nanmu, so the Crown Prince specially chose golden nanmu to make this box, hoping Zhu Changlan would like it.

Zhu Changlan picked up the wooden box curiously, feeling its warmth and delicate touch, the unique fragrance of golden nanmu lingering at his nose, making him feel particularly comfortable, clearly high-quality wood. He gently opened the box, hearing a "click" as the hinge turned smoothly, without the slightest stiffness. Inside was a layer of red velvet, soft and smooth, bright in color, making the contents inside especially eye-catching. On the velvet lay a wooden dagger—the handle made of a whole piece of golden nanmu, carved with intertwined lotus patterns, the lines flowing and lifelike, exactly the same as the pattern on his pear wood reclining chair, clearly made by the same craftsman. The length of the handle was just right, comfortable to hold, fitting the curve of the palm. The blade glinted with a cold light, clearly made of refined iron, sharp beyond compare, yet with a hint of warmth, clearly carefully polished, the edge smooth without any burrs. The blade was also carved with simple cloud patterns, simple and elegant, adding a touch of charm to the dagger.

"This is..."

Zhu Changlan picked up the dagger, examining it carefully, his eyes full of surprise. He had always liked wooden objects, and the handle material and craftsmanship of this dagger were both excellent, clearly taking a lot of effort to make.

"This was specially made for you by me," Zhu Changluo said with a smile, a hint of pride in his tone, like a child seeking praise, "I know you usually like to practice some martial arts, but you've never had a suitable weapon. Those metal weapons are either too heavy or too ostentatious, not suitable for you. This dagger's handle is made of golden nanmu, which is warm and you like it; the blade is forged from Western Region refined iron, hammered a thousand times and polished repeatedly, able to cut through iron like mud, sharp beyond compare—both for self-defense and for martial arts practice."

He paused, continuing, "I specially had the blade rounded a bit to prevent you from accidentally cutting yourself. The intertwined lotus pattern on the handle was carved by the craftsman according to your reclining chair; you should like it. To make this dagger, I looked for several craftsmen, compared several types of wood and steel, and finally decided, taking more than three months."

When Zhu Changluo spoke of the process of making the dagger, his eyes were full of seriousness, clearly taking a lot of effort.

Zhu Changlan held the dagger, his fingers caressing the wooden handle, feeling the delicate texture and warm touch, warmth welling up in his heart like a warm current. He could imagine how much effort the Crown Prince must have put into this dagger—when selecting materials, choosing the warmest and most suitable golden nanmu for the handle from many types of wood; when selecting steel, personally comparing the hardness and sharpness of various steels to choose the most suitable Western Region refined iron; when designing, considering his preferences and usage habits, designing the length and pattern of the handle to be just right; when forging, supervising the craftsman to repeatedly polish, ensuring the blade was sharp but not ostentatious, to prevent him from accidentally cutting himself. Every link was filled with the Crown Prince's heartfelt intention, every detail reflecting the Crown Prince's care. He gently waved the dagger, his movements light, the dagger flashing a cold light in the sun, but not dazzling. He could feel that the dagger was of moderate weight, comfortable in his hand, as if it was tailored for him.

"Thank you, Elder Brother," Zhu Changlan looked up, looking at Zhu Changluo, his tone sincere. In this deep palace, only the Crown Prince treated him sincerely, putting his preferences and safety first.

Zhu Changluo smiled, waving his hand, "We are brothers; no need for thanks. As long as you like it."

He paused, adding, "This dagger has another special feature—look at the end of the handle."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan looked at the end of the handle, where there was a small凹槽, inlaid with a small cat's eye stone, crystal clear, the vertical line light pattern rotating with the viewing angle, like a cat's eye staring at him.

"This cat's eye stone is a treasure specially obtained from the Western Regions, warm in texture, vivid in color," Zhu Changluo explained, his eyes full of tenderness, "I had it polished very round, both beautiful and able to balance the dagger, making it more顺手 when you wave it. Moreover, this cat's eye stone has the effect of nurturing the mind; carrying it with you not only calms the mind but also benefits your cultivation."

He paused, lowering his voice slightly, with a hint of caution, "I know you have your own cultivation path, although you've never细说, I can feel you're not an ordinary person. Last time you accidentally mentioned 'occasionally meditating' when you were drunk, and I remembered, specially finding this cat's eye stone, hoping it can help you."

When Zhu Changluo said this, his eyes were full of sincerity, without the slightest hint of inquiry, only pure concern.

Zhu Changlan's heart moved. He had never told anyone about his cultivation, except for accidentally mentioning "occasionally meditating" to the Crown Prince once when he was drunk. He never expected the Crown Prince to remember, and even specially found a warm jade that could nurture the mind for him. He looked at Zhu Changluo, his eyes filled with confusion and gratitude.

Zhu Changluo seemed to see through his thoughts, smiling and saying, "I know you're not an ordinary person and have many secrets."

His tone was calm, without the slightest surprise or inquiry, as if it was the most normal thing in the world, "But don't worry, I won't ask. Everyone has their own secrets, and I respect you."

His gaze was gentle and firm, like the warm spring sun, warm but not burning, "I only hope you can be safe and not be bullied. In this deep palace, people's hearts are unpredictable, full of open and hidden struggles. Your temperament is too温润, not knowing how to guard against others, easy to suffer. With this dagger by your side, you'll have something to defend yourself with when in danger, and I can feel more at ease."

He paused, continuing, "No matter what your identity is, no matter what secrets you have, you are my Ninth Brother, and I will always protect you. In front of me, you don't need any defenses; you can be yourself freely."

The Crown Prince's words were like a warm current, instantly flowing through Zhu Changlan's entire body, making him feel exceptionally warm and safe.

Looking at the Crown Prince's sincere eyes, Zhu Changlan was deeply moved, his eyes slightly red, almost shedding tears. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, experiencing the brutal battles of the demon world, where brothers turned against each other, friends betrayed, and everywhere was filled with intrigue. He had experienced the separation of life and death in the human world, witnessing too many joys and sorrows, the险恶 nature of human hearts—he had long seen through them all. He had seen too many people willing to do anything for power, status, and interests, even harming those around them. But never had anyone treated him like the Crown Prince, not asking about his past, not asking about his secrets, not seeking any return, only wholeheartedly protecting him, putting his safety first. In the demon world, he was the high and mighty Xuan Yu True Immortal, with powerful strength, but always lonely, without a single person he could trust. In the human world, he was an unfavored Ninth Prince, low in status, but because of the Crown Prince's protection, he felt warmth and care he had never felt before. The Crown Prince's heartfelt intention was pure and sincere, making him especially cherish it, and making him feel that his nearly thousand years of waiting and loneliness were all worth it. He held the dagger tightly, the warm touch of the handle coming through, making him feel particularly peaceful.

"Elder Brother, I..."

Zhu Changlan opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but didn't know what to say. Thousands of words finally condensed into one sentence, "You must take care of yourself too."

Zhu Changluo smiled, patting his shoulder with a warm and firm hand, full of reassuring strength: "I will."

He picked up the memorial on the table, his tone becoming a bit more serious, his brow furrowing slightly, clearly thinking of the disputes in the court: "But recently, the court is not peaceful. Consort Zheng and the Third Prince have been acting frequently, and they won't be安分. Consort Zheng has always wanted the Third Prince to inherit the throne and has long been dissatisfied with me. As my only close younger brother, you naturally have also become a thorn in Consort Zheng's side. Consort Zheng and the Third Prince have long wanted to get rid of you."

His tone was calm, but Zhu Changlan could hear the seriousness in it.

Zhu Changlan nodded, his expression also becoming serious, the smile on his face gradually fading. What the Crown Prince said was true; he had long heard of the ambitions of Consort Zheng and the Third Prince. Consort Zheng, the mother of the Third Prince, came from a prominent family with great power in the court and many supporters. The Third Prince Zhu Changxun was arrogant, domineering, narrow-minded, and extremely jealous, always jealous of the Crown Prince's position as the heir, opposing him at every turn. As the only brother close to the Crown Prince, he naturally became Consort Zheng's眼中钉, and Consort Zheng and the Third Prince had long wanted to eliminate him. A few days ago, he also heard that people from Consort Zheng's palace were inquiring about his whereabouts and preferences, surely not with good intentions, perhaps planning some conspiracy. Although he had cultivated for many years and had a certain amount of power, in this deep palace, there were rules and eyes everywhere. If he really had a conflict with Consort Zheng and the Third Prince, he would probably be in a dilemma, and would also implicate the Crown Prince. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel a little worried.

"I know, Elder Brother," Zhu Changlan said, "I will try to avoid them, not causing you any trouble."

"Silly brother," Zhu Changluo shook his head, his eyes filled with helplessness and affection, "You are not my trouble; you are my only brother, and it's natural for me to protect you."

He paused, his tone becoming exceptionally firm, "If they really attack you, you don't have to endure it—just fight back. With me here, no one can hurt you."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his heart warm as if wrapped in sunlight. The Crown Prince kept his word and always did what he said. When he first entered the palace, because he was not favored, no one in the palace took him seriously. There was a eunuch in charge of the charcoal supply for Xian'an Palace who thought him young and easy to bully, and not favored, so he deliberately克扣 his charcoal rations. In winter, the side hall of Xian'an Palace was exceptionally cold, and he often shivered from the cold, wrapping himself in thick quilts at night but still feeling the chill seeping into his bones. Once, when the Crown Prince came to see him, he saw him wearing tattered clothes, his small face red from the cold, and felt very心疼. Upon inquiry, he learned the eunuch had been克扣 the charcoal. The Crown Prince became angry on the spot, immediately having the eunuch arrested, directly flogging him thirty times until his skin was torn and his flesh was raw, then driving him out of the palace, never to be employed again. Moreover, the Crown Prince specially had someone inform the Internal Affairs Bureau, severely reprimanding the relevant officials, and ordering that Xian'an Palace's rations be doubled in the future, with severe punishment for anyone who dared to neglect them again. From then on, the palace people were even more respectful to him, not daring to neglect him in the slightest. This incident, he had always remembered, never forgetting the Crown Prince's protection.

The two chatted for a while longer, the topic gradually shifting from court disputes to poetry, and the atmosphere became much more relaxed. The Crown Prince knew Zhu Changlan liked poetry and often specially collected famous poems to discuss with him. The Crown Prince picked up a poetry collection on the table, opening it to a page and smiling, "Ninth Brother, look at this poem 'Invitation to Wine' by Li Bai: 'Heaven has given me talents, and they will surely be put to use; gold散尽还复来'—it's majestic and ambitious, making one's blood boil."

Zhu Changlan leaned over to look, nodding, "It's indeed well written. Li Bai's poems have always been bold and unrestrained, full of romanticism, making people admire him."

Zhu Changlan also shared his latest work, a poem about the mountains and waters of Kunlun, which read: "The snow of Kunlun reflects the cold sky, the sea of clouds connects to the distant mountains. A lone crane flies endlessly through the clouds, my heart follows the clear wind into the clouds."

Between the lines was his longing for freedom and his attachment to the mountains and waters of Kunlun. The Crown Prince listened with interest, nodding from time to time, and after Zhu Changlan finished reading, he paused for a moment, offering some pertinent suggestions: "The line 'The snow of Kunlun reflects the cold sky' is excellent, with a broad意境, depicting the magnificent scene of Kunlun snow-capped mountains. However, the word 'cold' seems a bit bleak; it would be better to change it to '闲' (leisure), which not only fits the quiet and distant snow scene but also matches your leisurely and indifferent temperament, and is more compatible with the following line 'My heart follows the clear wind into the clouds.'"

Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up, nodding quickly, "Elder Brother is absolutely right. 'The snow of Kunlun reflects the leisurely sky' is indeed more to my liking."

He never expected the Crown Prince not only to understand state affairs but also to have such unique insights into poetry.

As they chatted, Zhu Changlan remembered the osmanthus wine in his sleeve, taking it out and saying with a smile, "Elder Brother, this is the osmanthus wine I brewed a few days ago, using the golden osmanthus from last autumn, sealed for half a year. Please have a taste."

Zhu Changluo's eyes lit up, quickly taking the osmanthus wine, carefully opening the lid. A rich osmanthus fragrance mixed with rice wine aroma rushed out, clear and sweet, pure in fragrance without the slightest impurities, making him couldn't help but praise, "What a fragrant smell! Ninth Brother's craftsmanship is getting better and better; this fragrance is even stronger than last year's."

He took a deep breath, a look of intoxication on his face. He had someone bring two small porcelain cups, made of white porcelain with a fine texture, uniform glaze, painted with faint orchid patterns, lifelike and elegant, specially fired by Zhu Changlan, saying it best complemented the sweetness of the osmanthus wine. Zhu Changluo picked up a porcelain cup, smelling it at his nose, the清香 of the porcelain cup intermingling with the fragrance of the osmanthus wine,

Zhu Changluo poured two cups of osmanthus wine, handing one to Zhu Changlan, "Come, let's have a good drink today, just the two of us brothers."

Zhu Changlan took the wine cup, clinking it with the Crown Prince's, and took a small sip. The sweet wine slid down his throat, carrying the elegant fragrance of osmanthus and the richness of rice wine, warm but not strong, warming his entire body. He looked at the smile on the Crown Prince's face, his heart filled with happiness. In this deep palace, being able to have such a sincere elder brother, and such a pleasant time, was the greatest satisfaction for him.

The two drank osmanthus wine while chatting, from poetry to calligraphy and painting, from flowers and plants in the palace to interesting things outside. The Crown Prince talked about the new performers in the acrobatic troupe west of the city, who could swallow swords and breathe fire, attracting people to watch; about the storyteller in the teahouse south of the city, whose "Tales of Jianghu Heroes" was exciting, making people listen spellbound. Zhu Changlan listened with great interest, occasionally laughing out loud, his eyes full of longing. He hadn't left the palace for too long, full of curiosity about the outside world.

"When the court stabilizes in the future, I'll allow you to travel outside the palace," Zhu Changluo said with a smile, seeing his longing expression, "At that time, I'll prepare enough money for you, so you can go wherever you want, play as long as you like. You can go to Kunlun Mountain to see the snow scenery you've always wanted, go to the south of the Yangtze River to try their osmanthus cake, go to the seaside to see the fish schools you like."

Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up, a look of excitement on his face, "Really? Elder Brother, you won't lie to me?"

Traveling the world had long been his wish—he wanted to see the famous mountains and rivers outside, taste the delicacies from all over, and meet like-minded friends.

"Of course it's true," Zhu Changluo said with a smile, his eyes gentle and firm, "When have I ever lied to you? Once I stabilize the court and eliminate those treacherous officials, I'll go with you. Just the two of us brothers, traveling together, drinking wine and having fun—wouldn't that be wonderful?"

Zhu Changlan laughed happily, like a child who had received candy. He imagined himself traveling the world with the Crown Prince: riding horses, carrying swords, traveling through famous mountains and rivers, watching the snow scenery under Kunlun Mountain, admiring the lotus flowers in the water towns of the south of the Yangtze River, listening to the sound of waves by the sea, and finding a small tavern at night, ordering a few dishes, drinking his own brewed osmanthus wine, chatting—what a pleasant thing that would be.

Unknowingly, the sun had risen to the top of the sky. Xiaoxizi came in to report that lunch was ready, asking His Royal Highness and the Prince to move to the side hall to eat.

Zhu Changlan and Zhu Changluo got up, walking towards the side hall. On the dining table in the side hall, there was already a feast of dishes, both rare delicacies and light home-cooked dishes, clearly considering both of their tastes: steamed fish, white-cut chicken, stir-fried seasonal vegetables, winter melon and kelp soup, as well as the crab meat soup dumplings and almond tofu that Zhu Changlan liked—every dish was exquisite and delicious.

"These are all your favorite dishes. Please try them," Zhu Changluo said with a smile, putting a piece of steamed fish in Zhu Changlan's bowl. This fish was a crucian carp just caught from the Imperial River that morning, the meat tender. The Crown Prince specially instructed the cook to use less seasonings, only adding ginger slices to remove the fishy smell, preserving the fresh flavor of the fish to the greatest extent.

Zhu Changlan nodded, picking up the chopsticks and slowly tasting it. The fish meat was tender, melting in his mouth, with a faint fresh fragrance, exactly his favorite taste. He ate very happily; when with the Crown Prince, he always felt unprecedentedly relaxed and at ease, not needing to pretend, not needing to guard against, being able to be himself completely.

After lunch, Zhu Changluo took Zhu Changlan to visit the East Palace garden. The East Palace garden was much larger than that of Xian'an Palace, planted with all kinds of rare flowers and plants: peonies blooming luxuriantly, roses blooming brightly, orchids blooming elegantly, and many unnamed flowers competing to bloom, beautiful beyond compare. In the center of the garden was a small lake, with a few lotus leaves floating on the surface, and occasionally a few red koi swimming by, flicking their tails, stirring up ripples, appearing particularly vibrant.

"This garden was designed by me personally," Zhu Changluo said with a smile, a hint of pride in his tone, "Walking here in my free time, looking at the flowers and plants, makes my mood much more comfortable."

He pointed to a magnolia tree by the lake, "This magnolia tree was planted by myself when I first entered the East Palace. Now it has grown so big."

Following the Crown Prince's finger, Zhu Changlan saw that the magnolia tree was lush and leafy, with a thick trunk, its branches full of white magnolia flowers, like white clouds hanging on the branches, exceptionally beautiful. The petals were as white as snow, emitting a faint fragrance, floating with the wind, refreshing to the heart.

"Time flies so fast; in the blink of an eye, we brothers have known each other for so many years," Zhu Changluo said with emotion, his eyes full of reminiscence, "I still remember when you first entered the palace, you were so small, timid, hiding when you saw people, not even daring to speak. Now you've grown so big, becoming more and more mature."

Zhu Changlan looked at the magnolia tree, then at the Crown Prince, his heart also filled with emotion. He remembered when he first entered the palace through reincarnation, he was young and ignorant, full of fear for this strange world. It was the Crown Prince who had always taken care of him, teaching him to read and write, teaching him how to behave, protecting him when he was bullied, and accompanying him when he was lonely. Over the years, the Crown Prince had been like a bright lamp, illuminating his path in the deep palace, giving him warmth and support.

"Elder Brother, thank you," Zhu Changlan said sincerely, looking at the Crown Prince. This thank you contained too much gratitude, too much emotion.

Zhu Changluo smiled, patting his shoulder, "We are brothers; no need for thanks."

He paused, his eyes becoming exceptionally gentle, "No matter what happens in the future, never forget that you still have me as your elder brother. I will always protect you, forever."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his eyes a little moist. The Crown Prince's promise was as heavy as Mount Tai. In this deep palace, with the Crown Prince's words, he was not afraid of anything. No matter how many storms or obstacles he would face in the future, he had the courage to face them.

The two wandered in the garden for a while longer, chatting about past interesting stories and future expectations. Zhu Changlan talked about his clumsiness when he first learned to transform into a human form, about the惬意 time he spent sunbathing and catching fish under Kunlun Mountain, about the surprise he felt when he first drank osmanthus wine. The Crown Prince listened with great interest, occasionally laughing out loud, his eyes full of doting.

The sun set in the west, the sunset dyeing half the sky red, turning the entire East Palace into a warm yellow. Zhu Changlan knew it was time to return to Xian'an Palace. He looked at the Crown Prince reluctantly, saying, "Elder Brother, I should go back."

Zhu Changluo nodded, a warm smile on his face, "Alright, I'll see you off."

The two walked out of the East Palace side by side, not speaking along the way, but tacitly feeling the reluctance in each other's hearts. The begonia flowers along the palace road were still falling, like a gentle farewell.

At the palace gate, Zhu Changlan stepped onto the carriage, turning back to look at the Crown Prince, saying, "Elder Brother, you should also go back to rest early, don't overwork yourself. No matter how many matters there are in the court, you must take care of your health."

"I know," Zhu Changluo nodded, his eyes full of concern, "Be careful on the way. When you return to Xian'an Palace, send someone to inform me, so I can be at ease."

"Okay," Zhu Changlan replied.

The carriage slowly moved forward. Zhu Changlan sat in the carriage, lifting the curtain to watch the Crown Prince's figure gradually fade away, his heart filled with reluctance. He didn't know when they would be able to chat and drink so comfortably again. In the deep palace, one couldn't help oneself; the Crown Prince had his responsibilities and mission, and he had his own secrets and ties. Such times seemed especially precious.

When he returned to Xian'an Palace, it was already dark. Xiaoluzi had already prepared dinner and a pot of warm rice wine. Zhu Changlan sat at the dining table, but had no appetite. His mind was filled with images of being with the Crown Prince—his gentle smile, sincere eyes, thoughtful care, and the words "I will always protect you."

He picked up the wine jug, pouring himself a cup of rice wine, taking a small sip. The aroma of the wine filled his mouth, but it couldn't compare to the warmth in his heart. In this cold deep palace, the Crown Prince's warmth was the most precious thing in his life, the power supporting him through the long years.
