**Chapter 13: Tianqi Protects the Son of Heaven, A Loyal Minister Through Three Dynasties**

Late summer of the 48th year of Wanli's reign in the Ming Dynasty (1620).

The smoke from the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area had not yet completely dissipated, and the air still carried a faint scent of evil qi and blood. Zhu Changlan held the newly acquired Xuan Jade Miao Dao, standing by the spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins, his gaze deep as he looked at the clear spring water. The Eye of Horus gem emitted a soft glow, resonating with the golden demonic energy around him.

"Your Highness, urgent dispatch from the capital!" Commander Li of the Imperial Guard dark guards ran over, gasping for breath, holding a sealed letter with a red imperial seal, "The Emperor is critically ill! The Crown Prince urgently summons you back to the capital!"

Zhu Changlan's heart sank. He took the letter, opened it, and sure enough, the handwriting was indeed that of Crown Prince Zhu Changluo, the lines filled with anxiety and worry: "Ninth Brother, Father is on his deathbed, with little time left. Return to the capital immediately!"

"Assemble the troops at once, return to the capital!" Zhu Changlan ordered in a deep voice, sheathing the Xuan Jade Miao Dao.

The elite Imperial Guard dark guards quickly assembled. Zhu Changlan mounted his horse and led them galloping toward the capital. The scenery along the way flew by, and Zhu Changlan's mind kept returning to Crown Prince Zhu Changluo's face, as well as the years of love and resentment with the Wanli Emperor.

Zhu Changluo was the Wanli Emperor's eldest son but had never been favored by his father. The Wanli Emperor preferred the Third Prince Zhu Changxun, born to Consort Zheng, and repeatedly tried to depose the eldest son and establish the third. Thanks to the strong劝谏 of court ministers, Zhu Changluo's position as Crown Prince was preserved. Over the years, Zhu Changluo had lived cautiously, always on thin ice. As the Ninth Prince, Zhu Changlan had always firmly stood by the Crown Prince's side, supporting and protecting him.

Zhu Changlan's gaze hardened, tightening his grip on the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, a coolness spreading from his fingertips. The road ahead was full of thorns, but he had no reason to back down.

After several days of non-stop travel, Zhu Changlan finally arrived in the capital. Instead of returning to his own Xian'an Palace, he went directly to Ciqing Palace to visit Crown Prince Zhu Changluo.

The atmosphere in Ciqing Palace was unusually heavy. Palace maids and eunuchs all looked serious, their steps light, as if afraid to disturb those inside. Zhu Changlan hurried into the main hall, where Crown Prince Zhu Changluo sat at his desk, holding a memorial, his brows furrowed, his eye sockets sunken—clearly having not rested for many days.

"Ninth Brother!" When Zhu Changluo saw Zhu Changlan, his eyes immediately lit up. He stood up in a hurry, almost dropping the memorial in his hand, "You're finally back! Is the chaos at the Spiritual Vein resolved?"

Zhu Changlan stepped forward quickly, bowing, his voice steady as a pine: "Your Highness, the crisis at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area has been temporarily resolved. All remnants of the Black Bone Sect have been eliminated, and the evil qi in the spiritual veins has been purified. This Xuan Jade Miao Dao was obtained during this trip—it can slay demons, purify evil qi, and protect the origin of the spiritual veins." With that, he slowly drew the Miao Dao from his waist, the blade glowing with a gentle green light, like a pool of clear water.

Zhu Changluo stepped forward, gently touching the blade. A cool spiritual energy spread from his fingertips, and he showed genuine admiration: "What a good sword! With this divine weapon, Ninth Brother, you'll be even more confident in dealing with those demons and evil spirits. But..." His voice changed, his brows furrowing again, "Father has been in a coma for three days, and the imperial physicians are at a loss. That demoness Consort Zheng and the Third Brother are watching like tigers, and the Black Bone Sect is stirring trouble in the shadows... I'm afraid..."

Zhu Changluo's voice grew quieter, his clenched fists trembling slightly. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan stepped forward, reassuring him in a deep voice: "Brother, there's no need to worry too much. Father is blessed by heaven and will surely pull through this crisis. As for those demons and ghosts, I will spare no effort to protect you."

Hearing this, Zhu Changluo seemed to relax, patting Zhu Changlan's shoulder, his gaze full of trust: "Ninth Brother, from childhood, you've always been there when I need you most. At tomorrow's court session, ministers will discuss Father's funeral arrangements. Those opportunists will surely cause trouble. I need you in the court to stabilize the situation for me."

Zhu Changlan nodded solemnly: "Brother, rest assured. At tomorrow's court session, I will let those clowns know that Your Highness is the legitimate heir to the Ming Dynasty! Additionally, Brother must be more careful—the Black Bone Sect is skilled in demon techniques. Although the guards at Ciqing Palace have been strengthened, we still need hidden sentries. I will immediately arrange for elite Imperial Guard dark guards to secretly guard your bedroom."

Zhu Changluo smiled bitterly and shook his head: "Alright, I'll listen to you. You've always been thoughtful—with you here, I can feel more at ease."

The next day at the morning court, civil and military officials gathered in the Hall of Supreme Harmony to discuss the Wanli Emperor's funeral. Consort Zheng and the Third Prince Zhu Changxun's factions tried to delay time and create chaos, but were jointly suppressed by Zhu Changlan and ministers supporting the Crown Prince.

"Your Majesty!" Grand Secretary Fang Congzhe stepped forward steadily, his white beard fluttering, his voice calm and powerful, "The Crown Prince is the Emperor's legitimate eldest son and should inherit the throne according to ancestral rules! Now that the Emperor is critically ill, the country cannot be without a ruler for a single day. Please make a decision quickly!"

Minister of Rites Sun Ruyou followed immediately, stepping forward, his tone urgent: "Grand Secretary Fang is right! The Crown Prince is virtuous and benevolent, and has assisted the Emperor in handling state affairs over the years, winning the hearts of the people. If we don't establish the Crown Prince now, we fear changes may occur. Please think carefully, Your Majesty!"

"Hmph!" Minister of Rites Assistant Li Yangzheng stepped forward阴阳怪气, glaring at the Crown Prince, "The Emperor hasn't passed away yet. Discussing succession at this time is extremely disrespectful! I think we should wait for the Emperor to issue a will before discussing succession!"

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, his robes rustling, his gaze cutting through Li Yangzheng like a knife: "What do you mean, Minister Li? The Crown Prince is the legitimate eldest son—inheritance of the throne is natural justice! Do you want to defy ancestral rules and establish someone else?"

Li Yangzheng was intimidated by this aura, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead, stammering: "Ninth... Ninth Prince, I... I have no such intention... It's just..."

"Enough!" Zhu Changlan shouted, his voice shaking the hall, "The Crown Prince is virtuous and benevolent, the undisputed choice for the Ming Dynasty! If anyone dares to obstruct the Crown Prince's ascension, they are enemies of the entire Ming Dynasty! Don't blame me for being不客气!"

Zhu Changlan's words were powerful, shocking everyone present. Ministers supporting the Crown Prince echoed him one after another, while Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun's factions didn't dare to speak against him.

Just then, a young eunuch ran in panicking, kneeling on the ground, crying out: "Report to all lords, the Emperor has passed away!"

An uproar swept through the hall. Zhu Changluo swayed, almost falling. Zhu Changlan quickly stepped forward to support him, saying in a deep voice: "Your Highness, control your grief. This is the critical moment—you must stay strong!"

Zhu Changluo took a deep breath, stabilizing his emotions. He turned to the civil and military officials, declaring loudly: "The passing of Father is a sorrow for the Ming Dynasty. But the country cannot be without a ruler. This Crown Prince will inherit the throne, preside over Father's funeral, and lead the Ming Dynasty to prosperity and strength!"

The civil and military officials knelt, shouting: "Long live the Crown Prince! Long live the Ming Dynasty!"

Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun's factions had no choice but to kneel, their hearts filled with resentment and unwillingness.

On the first day of the eighth month in the 48th year of Wanli's reign (1620), Zhu Changluo officially ascended the throne, changing the reign title to Taichang, becoming the 14th emperor of the Ming Dynasty.

After ascending the throne, Emperor Taichang immediately issued a series of new policies: reducing taxes, rectifying officialdom, and focusing on the livelihood of the people, winning the love of the people. He ordered a one-year tax reduction nationwide to lighten the burden on the people; rectified officialdom, severely punishing corrupt officials and selecting talented individuals; focused on people's livelihoods, building water conservancy projects and controlling the Yellow River floods, allowing people to live and work in peace. The implementation of these new policies brought prosperity to the Ming Dynasty, and people praised Emperor Taichang as a virtuous ruler.

At the same time, Emperor Taichang also attached great importance to spiritual vein protection. He appointed Zhu Changlan as the Spiritual Vein Guardian Envoy, responsible for guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins and resisting the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy. He ordered heavy troops to be stationed around the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, strictly prohibiting anyone from entering the forbidden area without permission and damaging the Source of Spiritual Veins.

Every day, in addition to handling state affairs, Zhu Changlan studied the Black Bone Sect's movements. He dispatched elite Imperial Guard dark guards to secretly monitor the Black Bone Sect's activities and collect their intelligence. After a period of investigation, he discovered that the Black Bone Sect had not收敛 after the failure of the spiritual vein crisis, but had become more rampant. They secretly colluded with Consort Zheng's faction, attempting to use the Red Pill to murder Emperor Taichang, overthrow the new emperor, and establish Zhu Changxun as emperor.

Black Bone Sect cultists were active everywhere in the capital, secretly bribing officials, spreading rumors, and creating chaos. They also secretly contacted demons from various places, preparing to launch a rebellion. Zhu Changlan knew he had to act quickly to stop the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy.

Every day, he studied Black Bone Sect intelligence in Xian'an Palace, analyzing their plots. He often communicated with Taoist Priest Xuan Chen, discussing how to resist the Black Bone Sect's demon techniques. Xuan Chen told him that the Black Bone Sect's demon techniques originated from the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's soul-devouring demon techniques, which could only be countered with purification power. Therefore, Zhu Changlan paid more attention to training with the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, hoping to use its purification power to completely eliminate the Black Bone Sect.

Zhu Changlan also secretly strengthened the palace's guards, dispatching elite Imperial Guard dark guards to secretly protect Emperor Taichang's safety. He ordered a tight network to be spread throughout the capital, searching for Black Bone Sect cultists. Any cultist discovered was immediately arrested, with no tolerance.

Through these efforts, Zhu Changlan gained a great deal of intelligence about the Black Bone Sect, learning about their conspiracy. The Black Bone Sect leader had secretly bribed Imperial Physician Li Kezhuo from the Imperial Hospital, preparing to offer Emperor Taichang a pill called the "Red Pill," claiming it could prolong life. However, in reality, this Red Pill contained evil poison—it was the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy to murder Emperor Taichang.

Zhu Changlan immediately reported this intelligence to Emperor Taichang, hoping he would be vigilant and not take any unknown pills.

"Your Majesty, according to intelligence from the Imperial Guard dark guards, Black Bone Sect cultists have secretly bribed an Imperial Physician, preparing to offer Your Majesty a pill called the 'Red Pill,' claiming it can prolong life. But I suspect this Red Pill contains evil poison—it's the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy to murder Your Majesty."

Upon hearing this, Emperor Taichang furrowed his brows: "Ninth Brother, are you overthinking this? The Imperial Physicians in the Imperial Hospital were personally selected by me—how could they murder me? Besides, I just ascended the throne. This is a critical time to stabilize the situation, and it's not appropriate to make a big fuss."

Zhu Changlan said urgently: "Your Majesty, the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy is cunning and ever-changing—we cannot be too cautious! I suggest Your Majesty not take any unknown pills, especially the newly presented Red Pill from the Imperial Hospital."

Emperor Taichang waved his hand: "Ninth Brother, no need to worry. I have my own sense of propriety. You should go handle the spiritual vein protection matters first—the spiritual veins of the Ming Dynasty depend on you."

Zhu Changlan had no choice but to withdraw. Emperor Taichang had just ascended the throne and was eager to prove himself, unwilling to be seen as a weak emperor. But he knew the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy wouldn't stop easily, and Emperor Taichang was in great danger.

After returning to Xian'an Palace, Zhu Changlan immediately summoned the elite Imperial Guard dark guards, ordering: "Closely monitor the movements of the Imperial Hospital, especially those physicians with connections to Consort Zheng. Report immediately if anyone secretly offers the Red Pill!"

"Yes!" The elite Imperial Guard dark guards replied in unison.

However, Zhu Changlan's fears were realized. On the first day of the ninth month of the first year of Taichang's reign (1620), Emperor Taichang suddenly fell ill, bedridden. Imperial Physician Li Kezhuo from the Imperial Hospital offered a red pill, claiming it could cure all diseases.

"Your Majesty, this Red Pill is an immortal elixir I refined, capable of prolonging life and curing all diseases!" Li Kezhuo knelt before Emperor Taichang's bed, holding a delicate porcelain plate with a glowing red pill.

By this time, Emperor Taichang was already terminally ill, and could not listen to Zhu Changlan's advice. He took the Red Pill without hesitation: "If this Red Pill really cures my illness, I will appoint you as the head of the Imperial Hospital!"

When Zhu Changlan received the news, it was already too late. He hurried to Qianqing Palace, only to see Emperor Taichang vomiting blood, unconscious.

"Li Kezhuo! How dare you murder Your Majesty!" Zhu Changlan shouted angrily, drawing the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, pressing it against Li Kezhuo's neck.

Li Kezhuo was so frightened that he trembled all over, stammering: "Ninth Prince, spare me! It was Consort Zheng... Consort Zheng ordered me to do this! She gave me an evil pill, saying it could cure Your Majesty's illness, but I never thought... never thought it would be like this!"

"Consort Zheng!" A fierce light flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes, "Immediately send people to search Consort Zheng's palace and arrest everyone involved in the conspiracy!"

The elite Imperial Guard dark guards immediately acted, going to Consort Zheng's palace to search. Zhu Changlan stayed by Emperor Taichang's bed, filled with regret and self-blame. He hated himself for not stopping Emperor Taichang from taking the Red Pill, for not protecting his brother.

But it was all too late. On the first day of the ninth month of the first year of Taichang's reign (1620), Emperor Taichang Zhu Changluo passed away, reigning for only one month. This emperor who had just ascended the throne and tried to revitalize the court ultimately failed to escape the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy, leaving with endless regret.

The news of Emperor Taichang's death caused an uproar throughout the court and public. Consort Zheng and Third Prince Zhu Changxun's factions took the opportunity to cause chaos, attempting to establish Zhu Changxun as emperor. Zhu Changlan knew that at this moment, he must stabilize the situation, otherwise the Ming Dynasty would fall into chaos.

He immediately summoned ministers loyal to Emperor Taichang to discuss countermeasures.

"Ninth Prince, now that Your Majesty has passed away and Crown Prince Zhu Youxiao is young, what should we do?" Grand Secretary Fang Congzhe asked.

"Our top priority is to establish Crown Prince Zhu Youxiao as emperor to stabilize the situation," Zhu Changlan said in a deep voice. "Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun's factions will definitely cause trouble. We must strengthen palace guards to prevent them from launching a coup."

"Ninth Prince is right," Sun Ruyou agreed. "Crown Prince Zhu Youxiao is young, but he is the legitimate heir to the throne. We should immediately establish him as emperor to foil Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun's conspiracy."

"Good!" Zhu Changlan nodded. "Immediately arrange for Crown Prince Zhu Youxiao to ascend the throne in Qianqing Palace. At the same time, strengthen palace guards and arrest all those involved in the Red Pill Case!"

Under Zhu Changlan's leadership, Zhu Youxiao, the eldest son of Emperor Taichang, ascended the throne on the sixth day of the ninth month of the first year of Taichang's reign (1620), changing the reign title to Tianqi, becoming the 15th emperor of the Ming Dynasty.

When Emperor Tianqi ascended the throne, he was only 16 years old and still young. State affairs were handled by Zhu Changlan and Grand Secretary Fang Congzhe. Following his brother's last wish, Zhu Changlan wholeheartedly assisted the new emperor. He secretly deployed forces, quashing the rebellion of Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun, while also completely shattering the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy.

Unwilling to accept defeat, Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun's factions secretly contacted officials from various places, preparing to launch a rebellion to overthrow Emperor Tianqi. After learning of this intelligence, Zhu Changlan immediately took action, arresting Consort Zheng and Zhu Changxun's factions, completely shattering their rebellion.

Zhu Changlan also ordered a nationwide manhunt for Black Bone Sect cultists to completely eliminate the Black Bone Sect. He dispatched elite Imperial Guard dark guards to various places to search for Black Bone Sect cultists. Any cultist discovered was immediately arrested, with no tolerance. After a period of efforts, the Black Bone Sect was severely weakened and no longer dared to act openly.

"Ninth Uncle!" Emperor Tianqi Zhu Youxiao sat on the dragon throne, his hands gripping the armrests, tears in his eyes, his voice trembling slightly, "If it weren't for Uncle's efforts to turn the tide, I would have been killed by those rebellious ministers and traitors..."

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, bowing respectfully, his voice humble and steady: "Your Majesty, you speak too highly of me. As a member of the royal family, guarding the Ming Dynasty and assisting Your Majesty in ascending the throne is my duty."

Zhu Youxiao stood up from the dragon throne, walked to the palace steps, his gaze sincere as he looked at Zhu Changlan: "Uncle, I am young and sit on this dragon throne with fear. State affairs are complicated—please teach me more, and don't嫌弃 me for being foolish."

Zhu Changlan raised his head, a smile in his eyes, his tone softening: "Your Majesty is naturally intelligent, just needing time to gain experience. I will spare no effort to assist Your Majesty in governing the country, guarding the spiritual veins, and making the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy无处遁形."

Subsequently, Zhu Changlan detailed the current state of the Ming Dynasty and the various challenges it faced to Emperor Tianqi. He told Emperor Tianqi that although the Ming Dynasty appeared prosperous on the surface, it actually faced many crises. The Later Jin regime in the north was eyeing the Ming Dynasty, ready to invade at any time; Japanese pirates in the south often harassed coastal areas, bringing heavy disasters to the people; corrupt officials were rampant internally, and people lived in hardship; although the Black Bone Sect had been weakened, it still operated secretly, attempting to damage the Source of Spiritual Veins and overthrow the Ming Dynasty.

After hearing this, Emperor Tianqi was shocked, realizing the great responsibility on his shoulders. He vowed to study hard the way of governing, becoming a virtuous monarch and leading the Ming Dynasty to prosperity.

Zhu Changlan nodded slightly, his gaze falling on Emperor Tianqi. He didn't say more, just silently strengthening his resolve to assist the new emperor.

Every day, he was in Qianqing Palace, accompanying Emperor Tianqi in reading and writing, telling him stories of virtuous monarchs from history, teaching him how to govern the country and handle state affairs. He often took Emperor Tianqi out of the palace in plain clothes to learn about the people's lives, so he could understand the people's hardships and care more about their lives.

Under Zhu Changlan's teaching, Emperor Tianqi gradually grew up, beginning to understand how to govern the country and handle state affairs. He trusted Zhu Changlan more and more, regarding him as his most trusted assistant and mentor.

Zhu Changlan also attached great importance to the protection of the Source of Spiritual Veins. He often went to the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area to inspect the situation, ensuring the safety of the Source of Spiritual Veins. He also ordered the strengthening of the guards around the forbidden area, strictly prohibiting anyone from entering without permission.

He worked closely with Taoist Priest Xuan Chen, researching how to strengthen the seal of the Source of Spiritual Veins to prevent the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord from breaking free. Xuan Chen told him that the seal of the Source of Spiritual Veins needed to be maintained with the righteous qi of the spiritual veins. As long as the Source of Spiritual Veins had sufficient spiritual energy, the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord couldn't break free. Therefore, Zhu Changlan paid more attention to the protection of the Source of Spiritual Veins, hoping to make its spiritual energy more abundant, thus strengthening the seal on the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord.

Subsequently, Zhu Changlan reported the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy and the importance of the Source of Spiritual Veins to Emperor Tianqi. After hearing this, Emperor Tianqi was shocked and immediately appointed Zhu Changlan as the commander of the Imperial Guards, responsible for protecting the palace's safety, while also continuing to serve as the Spiritual Vein Guardian Envoy, responsible for protecting the Source of Spiritual Veins.

Zhu Changlan knew the responsibility was heavy, so he worked harder to handle state affairs and investigate the Black Bone Sect's movements. Only by completely eliminating the Black Bone Sect could the safety of the Source of Spiritual Veins and the stability of the Ming Dynasty be ensured.

One day, while handling state affairs in Xian'an Palace, Commander Li of the Imperial Guard dark guards came to report: "Your Highness, we've discovered a secret stronghold of the Black Bone Sect on the outskirts of the capital!"

"Take me there immediately!" A fierce light flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes. He picked up the Xuan Jade Miao Dao and followed Commander Li out of Xian'an Palace.

The Black Bone Sect's secret stronghold was located in an abandoned temple on the outskirts of the capital. Zhu Changlan led the elite Imperial Guard dark guards to secretly surround the temple, then broke down the door, engaging in fierce battle with the Black Bone Sect cultists.

Although the Black Bone Sect cultists were numerous, they were no match for Zhu Changlan and the elite Imperial Guard dark guards. Holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, Zhu Changlan moved continuously through the cultists' attacks, each strike carrying the dual power of jade purification and iron fierceness, slaying demons while purifying evil qi. Soon, all Black Bone Sect cultists in the temple were killed, leaving only one leader, trembling on his knees, begging for mercy.

"Speak! Where is your leader now? What's the current situation of Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's residual soul? What conspiracy are you gathering here for?" Zhu Changlan held the Xuan Jade Miao Dao against the leader's neck, his tone cold.

The leader was so frightened that he trembled all over, quickly saying: "P... Please spare me, Prince! Our... our leader has already gone to the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area with elite demons! He wants to seize the power of the Source of Spiritual Veins to help the Demon Lord break the seal! The Demon Lord's residual soul has recently detected fluctuations in spiritual vein energy, and his power is recovering. As long as the leader can seize the spiritual vein power, he can completely break the seal, allowing the Demon Lord to return to the world! We... we were just ordered to gather here, preparing to attack the people in the capital, attracting your attention, buying time for the leader..."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan was shocked. He never expected the Black Bone Sect leader to be so bold as to directly go to the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area to seize spiritual vein power. Although the guards at the forbidden area were strict, the Black Bone Sect leader's strength was not to be underestimated. If he succeeded in seizing the spiritual vein power, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"Assemble the troops immediately, go to the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area!" Zhu Changlan ordered loudly.

The elite Imperial Guard dark guards immediately assembled, following Zhu Changlan as they galloped toward the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area. They traveled day and night, finally arriving at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area early on the third day.

At the entrance of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, a large number of Black Bone Sect cultists and demons had already gathered. They held weapons, their bodies emitting thick evil qi, clearly waiting for the leader's order to attack the forbidden area.

Seeing this, Zhu Changlan immediately ordered an attack. Holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, he charged first, killing toward the Black Bone Sect cultists. With the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand, he was like a tiger adding wings, each strike carrying the dual power of jade purification and iron fierceness, slaying demons while purifying evil qi.

Seeing this, the Black Bone Sect cultists surrounded him, attempting to encircle Zhu Changlan and the elite Imperial Guard dark guards. But Zhu Changlan showed no fear. Holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, he moved continuously through the cultists' attacks, each swing carrying powerful force, slaying the cultists around him.

Just then, a black figure suddenly rushed out from behind the cultists, attacking Zhu Changlan. Zhu Changlan looked closely—it was the Black Bone Sect leader, dressed in white, surrounded by thick evil qi, holding a black long sword with a faint black glow, clearly a divine weapon eroded by evil qi.

"Zhu Changlan!" The Black Bone Sect leader's robes fluttered, his body surging with evil qi, his voice as harsh as nails on glass, "You've ruined my plans repeatedly. Today, you'll shed blood at the spiritual veins!"

Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand humming softly, his voice as calm as a cold pond: "The Black Bone Sect has committed heinous acts—today is your day of reckoning!"

With that, his figure moved like a blue lightning bolt, attacking the Black Bone Sect leader. The Xuan Jade Miao Dao collided with the black long sword, emitting a deafening hum, green spiritual energy and black evil qi intertwining into a strange light screen.

The Black Bone Sect leader's sword techniques were sinister and ruthless, each strike carrying evil qi that腐蚀人心, while Zhu Changlan countered with rigidity, each strike containing spiritual energy that purifies all things. The two fought hundreds of rounds, still evenly matched.

Just as Zhu Changlan was slightly out of breath, the Black Bone Sect leader suddenly smiled诡异, his long sword suddenly growing several times larger, carrying thick evil qi stabbing toward his chest: "Die!"

Zhu Changlan's pupils constricted as he dodged sideways, but was still scratched by the sword blade. Black evil qi entered his body through the wound, like countless poisonous insects gnawing at his meridians. He endured the intense pain, activating the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Technique," the golden pearl light shining brightly, gradually purifying the evil qi.

"Heaven and earth are mysterious and yellow! All techniques and weapons follow!" Zhu Changlan suddenly opened his eyes, a shout like thunder exploding, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand erupting with brilliant green light, illuminating the entire Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area.

The green light, carrying destructive purification power, swept toward the Black Bone Sect leader. The leader's face changed drastically, wanting to dodge, but was firmly locked by the light.

"Ah!" The Black Bone Sect leader let out a shrill scream, his shoulder hit by the green light, the evil qi quickly purified, revealing a bloody wound. He looked at Zhu Changlan in terror, his voice trembling: "You... you have such power!"

Zhu Changlan held the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, stepping forward step by step: "The Black Bone Sect goes against the trend—today is your time to pay for your crimes!"

Seeing this, the Black Bone Sect leader didn't dare to fight any longer, turning into a wisp of black smoke to escape, not forgetting to threaten: "Zhu Changlan! This仇我黑骨教他日必报！你等着！"

After the Black Bone Sect leader escaped, the remaining cultists and demons also scattered in all directions. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan immediately ordered a pursuit, killing most of the Black Bone Sect cultists and demons.

The crisis at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area was finally resolved. Zhu Changlan stood by the spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins, looking at the clear spring water, his fingertips gently caressing the hilt of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao.

After returning to the capital, Zhu Changlan reported the details of this spiritual vein crisis to Emperor Tianqi. Emperor Tianqi was very pleased, heavily patting Zhu Changlan's shoulder, saying: "Ninth Uncle, you are truly a loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty! With you here, I can rest assured."

"Your Majesty overpraises me—this is my duty," Zhu Changlan bowed, "However, although the Black Bone Sect leader escaped, his forces still exist. I suggest Your Majesty strengthen the guards at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area while conducting a nationwide manhunt for Black Bone Sect cultists to completely eliminate the Black Bone Sect."

"Ninth Uncle is right," Emperor Tianqi nodded, "I will immediately issue an edict to strengthen the guards at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area and order the Imperial Guards to conduct a nationwide manhunt for Black Bone Sect cultists."

Subsequently, Emperor Tianqi appointed Zhu Changlan as Grand Tutor of the Crown Prince, responsible for teaching his younger brother Zhu Youjian. Zhu Changlan knew that although Zhu Youjian was young, he was intelligent and would achieve great things in the future. He carefully taught Zhu Youjian to read and write, imparting the way of governing, hoping he would become a virtuous monarch.

One day, while teaching Zhu Youjian in Xian'an Palace, Taoist Priest Xuan Chen suddenly visited.

"Your Highness, I've come today with important news," Taoist Priest Xuan Chen bowed.

"Please sit, Taoist Priest. What important news do you have?" Zhu Changlan invited Xuan Chen to sit, personally pouring him a cup of tea.

Xuan Chen took the cup, took a sip, and said: "Your Highness, I recently found records about the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord in ancient books at Qingyun Temple. According to the records, the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord was an extremely fierce figure in the ancient demon realm, specializing in soul-devouring demon techniques. Back then, he slaughtered three major sects with his own strength, nearly overthrowing the order of the three realms. To protect all living beings, the ancestor of the Snow Spirit Cat clan exhausted all his cultivation with his Life Soul Pearl, sealing him beneath the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, using the righteous qi of the spiritual veins to suppress his demonic power."

Upon hearing this, Zhu Changlan's heart sank. The Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's strength was not to be underestimated—if he broke the seal and awakened, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"Taoist Priest, how should we respond?" Zhu Changlan asked.

Xuan Chen said: "According to the records, the seal of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord requires suppression from the righteous qi of the spiritual veins. As long as the Source of Spiritual Veins has sufficient spiritual energy, the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord cannot break the seal. But the Black Bone Sect leader has been trying to damage the Source of Spiritual Veins. If he succeeds, the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord will break the seal and awaken, plunging the three realms into chaos."

Zhu Changlan nodded: "What you said is extremely true. The safety of the Source of Spiritual Veins is related to the safety of the three realms. I will spare no effort to guard the safety of the Source of Spiritual Veins, preventing the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord from breaking the seal and awakening."

Xuan Chen said: "I'm deeply relieved by Your Highness's determination. The purpose of my visit today is to tell Your Highness that the disciples of Qingyun Temple are ready to assist Your Highness in guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins and resisting the threat of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord."

Hearing this, Zhu Changlan was overjoyed: "Thank you, Taoist Priest! With the assistance of the Qingyun Temple disciples, my confidence in fighting the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord and the Black Bone Sect has increased even more."

Xuan Chen said: "Your Highness is welcome. Guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins is the responsibility of every cultivator. I believe that as long as we work together, we will definitely be able to resist the threat of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord and guard the peace of the three realms."

Zhu Changlan nodded: "You're right. As long as we work together, we will definitely be able to resist the threat of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord and guard the peace of the three realms."

After seeing off Xuan Chen, Zhu Changlan sat at his desk, gazing at the night sky outside the window, lost in thought for a long time.

He picked up the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, gently stroking the blade. The Big Dipper pattern on the blade glowed faintly in the moonlight, resonating with the Eye of Horus gem at the hilt.

Outside, the moonlight was like water, pouring over Zhu Changlan, coating him in a silver glow.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, Emperor Tianqi had been on the throne for three years. With Zhu Changlan's assistance, the Ming Dynasty presented a prosperous scene. The Source of Spiritual Veins had increasingly abundant spiritual energy, the Black Bone Sect was becoming weaker, and the seal on the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord was becoming stronger.

However, Zhu Changlan knew this was only temporary peace. Although the Black Bone Sect leader had escaped, he would definitely return, again attempting to damage the Source of Spiritual Veins and help the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord break the seal. He must always remain vigilant, never relaxing for a moment.

One day, while inspecting the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, Zhu Changlan suddenly felt a powerful evil qi emanating from the spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins. His heart sank, immediately activating his demonic energy and pearl power, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, walking toward the spring.

The evil qi around the spring became thicker and thicker. Zhu Changlan could clearly feel the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's residual soul awakening, attempting to break the seal. He immediately channeled the power of the Life Soul Pearl into the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, striking a green sword qi at the spring.

The green sword qi, carrying powerful purification power, surged into the spring, colliding fiercely with the evil qi inside, emitting a hissing sound. Zhu Changlan continuously waved the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, injecting green sword qi after green sword qi into the spring, trying to suppress the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's residual soul.

Just then, a black figure suddenly rushed out of the spring, attacking Zhu Changlan. Zhu Changlan looked closely—it was the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord, emitting thick evil qi, his eyes flashing with bloodthirsty light.

"Zhu Changlan!" The residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord let out a low roar like from hell, his voice shaking the entire Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, "You've ruined my plans repeatedly—today you will become a sacrifice for my revival!"

Evil qi surged around him, forming countless black tentacles, sweeping toward Zhu Changlan. A cold light flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand shining brightly: "Xuan Yuan Demon Lord, you've harmed all living beings—today I'll act on behalf of heaven, completely purifying your residual soul!"

With that, his figure moved like lightning, the Miao Dao in his hand turning into a blue streamer, slashing at the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord. The Xuan Jade Miao Dao collided with the black tentacles, emitting a harsh tearing sound, green spiritual energy continuously purifying the black evil qi.

Zhu Changlan knew the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's residual soul had just awakened, his power not yet fully restored—this was the best opportunity to eliminate him. He took a deep breath, channeling all his demonic energy, the Life Soul Pearl shining brightly, resonating with the Xuan Jade Miao Dao.

"Heaven and earth are mysterious and yellow! All techniques and weapons follow!" Zhu Changlan shouted, the Miao Dao in his hand erupting with unprecedented brilliant green light, like the rising sun, illuminating the entire Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area. The green light, carrying destructive purification power, wrapped around the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord.

"Ah!" The residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord let out a earth-shattering scream, the black evil qi quickly being purified, the residual soul beginning to dissipate. He looked at Zhu Changlan in terror, his voice filled with disbelief: "Impossible! I am an ancient demon lord—how could I be destroyed by a junior like you!"

Zhu Changlan's face was expressionless, the Miao Dao in his hand continuing to release purification power: "Good and evil are ultimately rewarded. You've harmed all living beings—today is your day of reckoning!"

"Zhu Changlan!" The residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord let out a final roar, "I won't let you go! Even if I'm scattered, I will come back to take revenge!"

As the green light continued to strengthen, the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord finally completely dissipated, leaving only a wisp of faint black gas, completely purified by the spring water of the Source of Spiritual Veins.

The evil qi in the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area finally completely dissipated. Zhu Changlan stood by the spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins, looking at the clear spring water, his heart filled with emotion. Although the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord was completely eliminated, the Black Bone Sect leader was still at large, and the threat to the Ming Dynasty still existed. He must continue to work hard, guarding the safety of the Source of Spiritual Veins, guarding the Ming Dynasty.

After returning to the capital, Zhu Changlan reported the details of this spiritual vein crisis to Emperor Tianqi. Emperor Tianqi was very pleased, heavily patting Zhu Changlan's shoulder, saying: "Ninth Uncle, you are truly a loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty! With you here, I can rest assured."

"Your Majesty overpraises me—this is my duty," Zhu Changlan bowed, "However, the Black Bone Sect leader is still at large, and we cannot be careless. I suggest Your Majesty continue to strengthen the guards at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area while conducting a nationwide manhunt for the Black Bone Sect leader to completely eliminate the Black Bone Sect."

"Ninth Uncle is right," Emperor Tianqi nodded, "I will immediately issue an edict to strengthen the guards at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area and order the Imperial Guards to conduct a nationwide manhunt for the Black Bone Sect leader."

From then on, Zhu Changlan continued to assist Emperor Tianqi in governing the country, guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins, and resisting the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy. Under his assistance, the Ming Dynasty gradually recovered its vitality,呈现出一片繁荣昌盛的景象. People praised Emperor Tianqi as a wise monarch, and Zhu Changlan was regarded as a loyal minister through three dynasties, his name going down in history as a legend of the Ming Dynasty.
