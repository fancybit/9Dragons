# English Synopsis

*Nine Dragon Cultivation Record* follows Zhu Changlan, the carefree Ninth Prince of the Ming Dynasty, who discovers he is the reincarnation of the ancient Meta Jade Emperor and a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan. After awakening his demon powers and obtaining the mystical Meta Jade Seedlings Blade, he uncovers a conspiracy involving the evil Black Bone Sect, who seek to release the powerful Meta Hell Demon Lord.

As Zhu Changlan navigates treacherous palace politics and battles the Black Bone Sect, he learns of his deep connection with the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord—they were once brothers who guarded the Three Realms' balance. With help from Daoist Meta Morning and blacksmith  Old Iron Head , he begins a quest to find fragments of the Kalaba Tree of Life, which holds the power to purify the Underworld aura within his fallen brother.

Blending Chinese mythology, kabbalistic mysticism, and tarot wisdom, the story follows Zhu Changlan's transformation from a "foolish" prince to a wise cultivator. With the Three Realms' fate hanging in the balance, he must embrace his destiny and unite with the mysterious Songlan Society to stop the Black Bone Sect and resolve his thousand-year bond with his brothers.

*Covering the first 15 chapters, this synopsis sets the stage for Zhu Changlan's epic journey ahead.*
