# Chapter 4: Assassination Panic, Instinct to Protect Brother

Ming Dynasty Wanli Era, 25th Year of Wanli, Late Spring Night.

The palace banquet in the Imperial Garden had already reached the third quarter of the Dog Hour. The golden glow from the gilded palace lanterns spread along the water waves of Taiye Pool, dyeing the成片的 Yao Huang and Wei Zi peonies in warm gold. The evening wind carried the aroma of aged Nu'er Hong wine, wrapped with the sweet scent of peonies and the sound of silk and bamboo, swirling between the white marble palace walls, but it couldn't dispel the faint tension in the air

------ This was the "Late Spring Peony Appreciation" banquet personally hosted by Consort Zheng.

In name, it was a state banquet for Western Region envoys, but in reality, it was a private gathering for Third Prince Zhu Changxun to win over court officials. Even the song and dance troupe was specially brought from Jiangnan by Consort Zheng

"Qingyin Troupe", singing songs that secretly praised the Third Prince as "virtuous" in every line.

Zhu Changlan sat in a corner of the west side hall, his fingers unconsciously caressing the cat's eye stone on the dagger at his waist. The gem sent by the Crown Prince glowed with a faint blue light in the palace lanterns, like holding a handful of crushed stars, making his nerves, which were drowsy from wine, slightly清醒. On the table in front of him was a plate of cold crystal shrimp dumplings, specially sent by the East Palace kitchen half an hour ago. The skins were thin translucent wheat starch skins, and the filling was shelled Taihu shrimp, but he had no appetite, only occasionally picking up the teacup to take a sip of warm tea. The tea was Lapsang Souchong, new tea just sent by Xiaoxizi from the Crown Prince this morning, but at this moment, the tea aroma mixed with the wine smell, only leaving a bitter taste.

"Ninth Brother, why aren't you eating?"

Crown Prince Zhu Changluo's voice came from behind, with a deliberately light smile. He had just finished socializing with several old ministers from the Ministry of Revenue, the cuffs of his bright yellow daily robe stained with half a wine stain, spilled during the toast earlier. His eyebrows were pressed with a layer of tiredness, but he deliberately walked half a circle from the main seat to this remote side hall.

Zhu Changlan looked up, a soft smile spreading in his eyes, like melted sugar: "Elder Brother, these shrimp dumplings are cold, the skins are hard, not as soft as the ones just steamed in the East Palace kitchen."

The Crown Prince sat in the empty seat beside him, pushing over the bowl of almond tofu still emitting steam in front of him ------

The bowl was white porcelain, painted with orchids, a birthday gift from Zhu Changlan last year. "I just had Xiaoxizi warm it on the brazier, you try it, it's still your favorite sweetness."

His gaze swept over the main seat not far away ------

Third Prince Zhu Changxun was holding a jade cup, serving food to the Western Region envoys, his smile as张扬 as overblown peonies; Consort Zheng sat on the main seat, her fingertips caressing a mutton fat jade bracelet, her nail polish red as blood, but her eyes kept glancing towards the Crown Prince's direction, like ice-cold needles, piercing the skin.

"Today's banquet is a stage set by Consort Zheng for the third brother."

The Crown Prince's voice was very low, almost贴着 Zhu Changlan's ear, his warm breath brushing over his earlobe, making his tail phantom unconsciously sway (only the Crown Prince could see this fluffy cat tail), "The'guards' brought by the Western Region envoys are not good people

------ I had the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards investigate; their waist tokens are fake, and the calluses on their hands are from holding swords."

Zhu Changlan's fingertips paused, the blue light of the cat's eye stone dimmed. His nose moved slightly ------

In addition to the wine and flower scents, there was also a hint of cold blood in the air, like blood covered with frost, coming from those "guards". This scent was too familiar to him, it was the "Soul Locking Incense" commonly used by evil cultivators in the demon world, which could numb people's five senses, convenient for sneak attacks.

"Elder Brother, I smell demon aura."

Zhu Changlan's voice was as light as a breath, "It's a half-demon, refined, from the same group as the eunuch at today's palace banquet, in the shadow behind the Third Prince."

The Crown Prince's brows furrowed even more, his fingers unconsciously扣着 the table: "I've let the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards guard the exit of the side pavilion. After the banquet, you follow me closely, don't leave my side半步

------ The'play' Consort Zheng invited today is probably meant for us."

Zhu Changlan nodded, scooping a spoonful of almond tofu into his mouth. The sweet fragrance slid down his throat, wrapped with milk aroma, his favorite taste, but his heart was beating faster and faster

He had lived for nearly a thousand years, seen the most ruthless battles in the demon world, where demons would tear their own kind to pieces for a single spiritual herb, but he had never been so panicked as now. This deep palace was like an airtight cage, the Crown Prince was the brightest light in the cage, naturally becoming the target of everyone, and he, this cat demon who had borrowed a human body, was determined to protect this light, not letting it be swallowed by darkness.

1. Undercurrents: Blade Light Hidden in Silk and Bamboo

The sound of silk and bamboo suddenly changed, from "Rainbow Skirt Song" to the Western Region's "Whirling Dance Music". The drumbeats fell like raindrops, shaking the heart. Consort Zheng raised her hand to tidy the red gold hairpin at her temples, smiling and speaking, her voice sweet as if wrapped in honey: "I've heard that the Western Region has 'Shadow Guard Sword Dance', both powerful and magnificent. Why not ask the envoys' guards to perform, adding some fun to today's peony banquet?"

As soon as these words were spoken, the noise in the hall instantly quieted down. A few old ministers paused with their wine cups, a flash of panic in their eyes

------ Everyone knew that "Shadow Guards" were dead soldiers of the Western Region vassal states, how could they be used to "perform sword dance"?

"We obey Consort Zheng's order." The Western Region envoy stood up, clapping his hands, his smile like oiled paper.

Three black shadows jumped into the hall from behind the corridor pillars outside, dressed in black masks, only露出 pairs of cold eyes. They landed silently, like three night cats, their short knives glowing with a green light in the palace lanterns

------ Not ordinary iron, but "cold iron" from the Western Region snow mountains, quenched with snow mountain snake venom, killing with a single drop of blood.

When the sword dance began, the blade light swept over the tables, splitting a plate of preserved fruit into pieces. Jujube paste filling splattered on an official's robe, and the official's face turned pale, but he didn't dare to leave his seat

Consort Zheng held her wine cup, the corner of her mouth hooked with a faint smile, but her eyes locked on the Crown Prince's direction, like a hunter staring at prey.

Zhu Changlan's fingertips tightened around the dagger handle. He could hear the heartbeats of the three black shadows, fast as drums, sweat soaking the handle. This was not a sword dance, but a killing move

------ Their blade paths were all directed at the Crown Prince's seat, every swing bringing them one inch closer to the Crown Prince.

"Elder Brother, their knives are aimed at you."

Zhu Changlan's voice was as light as a feather, "When I count to three, we retreat to the side pavilion ------ the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards is waiting outside the side pavilion."

The Crown Prince's fingertips pressed on his wrist, the warm touch calming his restlessness: "Don't rush, wait for them to show their flaw."

The blade light suddenly turned, and the three black shadows pounced on the Crown Prince's seat at the same time!

The guests' screams pierced the night sky, Consort Zheng "panicked" and stood up, knocking over her wine cup: "Protect the Emperor! Quickly protect the Emperor!" But the palace people behind her were like nails to the ground, not one stepping forward ------

This was her plot, how could she let anyone ruin it?

Zhu Changlan stood up almost instinctively, shielding the Crown Prince behind him. The dagger at his waist "噌" sounded as it was drawn, the cat's eye stone bursting with a blinding blue light ------ this was the "Demon Suppressing Stone" specially found by the Crown Prince for him, which could suppress evil black qi, his protective talisman, now becoming a shield protecting the Crown Prince.

"Dang!"

The dagger collided with the cold iron knife, sparks splattering on Zhu Changlan's back of the hand, burning his fingertips numb. The black shadow's strength was immense, his wrist bone aching, but he didn't retreat, instead using the recoil to side step, the dagger sliding along the knife, cutting a deep bone-deep wound on the opponent's arm.

Black qi poured out of the wound, like ink splashed into water. The black shadow screamed, but didn't retreat, instead pouncing more fiercely, the short knife stabbing directly at Zhu Changlan's chest

------ He was a half-demon, no pain, as long as he wasn't dead, he would keep killing.

"Ninth Brother!" The Crown Prince's scream sounded, with a panic he had never heard before.

Zhu Changlan's tail phantom swayed behind him, his body curling flexibly like a cat, avoiding the fatal blow. His elbow hit the opponent's ribs, the sound of bone breaking could be heard, and at the same time, the dagger reversed, precisely piercing the shadow's dantian

------ The demon power of a half-demon is concentrated in the dantian, this strike directly disabled the opponent's cultivation.

The black shadow collapsed like a deflated skin, black qi gushing out from the wound, quickly breathless. His eyes were still open, filled with unrepentant malice.

2. Panic: The Warmth Protected with Life

The remaining two black shadows, seeing their companion killed, their cold eyes became even colder. They no longer hid, turning to the Crown Prince at the same time, the blade light covering him like a spider web, sealing all his escape routes.

Although the Crown Prince had practiced martial arts, it was just a花架子 for fitness, never having seen such ruthless killing. He barely avoided the first knife, but his back hit the red wooden corridor pillar, making him groan in pain, sweat instantly breaking out on his forehead.

"Elder Brother!" The corners of Zhu Changlan's eyes instantly turned red, like blood-stained begonia.

His demon power was fully released, the blue light of the cat's eye stone wrapping around the dagger, pouncing like a lightning bolt at the black shadow closest to the Crown Prince. The crisp sound of blades colliding rang in his ears, his wrist was so shaken it went limp, the dagger almost falling out of his hand, but he held on tightly

This was a gift from the Crown Prince, the only thing that could warm him on the cold nights in Xian'an Palace. Now it was his turn to use it to warm the Crown Prince. Xian'an Palace was the residence specially arranged for him by the Empress, his only safe haven in the deep palace, and a witness to the brotherhood between him and the Crown Prince.

"You lazy cat, how dare you ruin the master's plan!"

One of the black shadows removed his mask, revealing a pale face, his pupils were strange vertical pupils ------

It was the eunuch behind the Third Prince! His face twisted with anger, like crumpled paper.

The tip of Zhu Changlan's ear trembled, the hair on his tail standing up like needles: "Your master is the Third Prince?"

"So what!"

The eunuch's voice was hoarse and harsh, like grinding stones, "The Crown Prince is in the way of the Third Highness, he should die here today! This Ming Dynasty's江山 should belong to the Third Highness!"

His short knife suddenly turned, stabbing at Zhu Changlan's shoulder. The cold poison on the blade touched the blood, instantly drilling into his heart along the meridians, like countless ice needles stabbing, causing him to see blackness. His brocade robe was instantly soaked with blood, red as splashed ink peonies, but he didn't retreat, instead taking a step forward, shielding the Crown Prince even tighter.

"Ninth Brother, your wound ------"

The Crown Prince wanted to pull him, but was entangled by another black shadow, the short knife grazing his waist, the fabric torn, revealing a shallow wound.

Zhu Changlan bit his teeth, pouring his demon power into the dagger. The blue light of the cat's eye stone became more and more intense, even suppressing the black qi, like a sun in the dark. He remembered the Crown Prince, on a snowy night in Xian'an Palace, bursting in holding a quilt, red-eyed saying

"Ninth Brother, from now on, I will never let you freeze again"; remembered the osmanthus wine in the East Palace, sweet as soaked in honey; remembered the chat under the magnolia tree, the Crown Prince saying

"When the court stabilizes, I will accompany you to see the snow on Kunlun Mountain"------

These warm things, like sunlight, must not be destroyed by this black qi. Absolutely not.

"If you want to kill Elder Brother, you have to get past me first!" His voice carried the smell of blood, like broken glass.

His figure suddenly became erratic, like a cat shuttling through the blade light. This was the "Entwined Silk Step" he learned in the demon world, used to escape, now used to kill. The cold light of the dagger grazed the eunuch's neck, bringing a string of blood beads, like broken red beads.

The eunuch's eyes changed abruptly, clearly not expecting this "lazy cat who even finds walking tiring"

cat demon to have such speed. His black qi suddenly burst out, like an open black net, wrapping Zhu Changlan inside. The short knife stabbed directly at Zhu Changlan's abdomen

------ This is the vital point of a demon, once stabbed, the demon power will disperse, unable to maintain human form.

Zhu Changlan couldn't avoid it. He could feel the cold poison crawling into his heart along the meridians, could feel the black qi wrapping around his bones, but his first reaction was to side step, letting the blade graze his waist instead of stabbing his vital point. Blood instantly soaked his robe, flowing down his leg, pooling into a small滩 on the bluestone, like blooming red plum.

"噗嗤"------ The dagger stabbed fiercely into the eunuch's forehead.

That's the "spirit aperture" of a half-demon, the only death spot. The black qi instantly dispersed, like a punctured ink bag, splattering everywhere. The eunuch's body stiffened, the light in his vertical pupils gradually dimming, finally becoming死寂. He

"dong" fell to the ground, never moving again.

The remaining black shadow, seeing the leader killed, turned to jump into Taiye Pool to escape. Zhu Changlan's dagger flew out, like a lightning bolt, precisely钉 on the opponent's calf.

"Ah ------"

The black shadow screamed and fell, his knee hitting the bluestone, breaking. Soon, the Dark Department of the Imperial Guards swarmed in from outside the side pavilion, pressing him to the ground, chains rattling

"hua hua".

3. Lingering Warmth: Morning Light by the Bed

The noise of the palace banquet completely turned into chaos. Consort Zheng "panicked" shouted

"Protect the Emperor", her hair disheveled, but no one dared to approach her ------

Everyone knew that this was her plot. Third Prince Zhu Changxun hypocritically gathered around, patting the Crown Prince's back, but his eyes glanced at the bodies on the ground, hiding malice, like a hissing snake.

Zhu Changlan's demon power was completely exhausted, his eyes seeing blackness. He grabbed the Crown Prince's sleeve, his fingertips cold, his voice as light as a feather: "Elder Brother......

I'm fine."

Before he finished speaking, he collapsed into the Crown Prince's arms. In his last consciousness, it was the Crown Prince's warm embrace, his panicked heartbeat, his voice calling

"Ninth Brother", like a spring breeze, wrapping him as he sank.

When he woke up again, it was the third quarter of the Tiger Hour (around 4:45 AM). The tip of his nose smelled the familiar sandalwood, the scent of the East Palace side hall. He was lying on the Crown Prince's bed, covered with Jiangnan tribute cotton mattress, soft as clouds. The wounds on his shoulder and waist were wrapped in bandages, with the best "muscle-growing powder" from the Imperial Medical Academy. The faint medicinal fragrance mixed with the warm fragrance of cloth, completely relaxing his tense nerves.

"Awake?"

The Crown Prince's voice was tired but gentle. He sat on a soft stool by the bed, holding a volume of "Classic of Poetry" in his hand, the pages crumpled, the corners of his eyes were red from staying up, like rubbed red peaches.

Zhu Changlan moved his fingertips, finding that his hand was held by the Crown Prince ------

His hand was very warm, like spring sunlight, wrapping his hand, making the pain of his wound lighter. He curled his fingertips, touching the calluses on the Crown Prince's palm, from holding a brush.

"Elder Brother, you didn't sleep?" Zhu Changlan's voice was hoarse, like grinding sandpaper.

The Crown Prince put down the book, picking up a bowl of ginseng soup warmed on the brazier beside him ------

The bowl was his usual white porcelain bowl, painted with orchids. "The imperial physician said you injured your meridians, need to be warmed, can't cut off the heat." He scooped up the ginseng soup, blowing on it repeatedly before bringing it to Zhu Changlan's mouth, "Drink slowly, don't choke ------

This is old ginseng from Changbai Mountain, stewed for three hours, not bitter."

The sweet warmth of the ginseng soup slid down his throat, comforting his empty stomach. Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince's profile ------

The light cast a faint shadow under his eyes, his eyelashes drooping like fluttering butterfly wings, a gentleness he had never seen before. He moved his fingertips, touching the Crown Prince's wrist, like a cat rubbing against a person's hand.

"Elder Brother, about today's matter......" Zhu Changlan opened his mouth, but was interrupted by the Crown Prince.

"It's all over."

The Crown Prince's fingertips brushed his temples, his movements as light as touching fragile porcelain, "The Dark Department of the Imperial Guards interrogated that the eunuch was a remnant of the Black Bone Sect, unrelated to the Third Prince

Consort Zheng pushed all the blame onto the Western Region envoys, saying they were'using sword dance to assassinate', and they've already been imprisoned in the sky prison."

Zhu Changlan's fingertips curled. This was Consort Zheng's trick, throwing the dirty water on outsiders to protect the Third Prince. But he didn't say anything else, just looked at the Crown Prince, his eyes like soaked soft jade: "Elder Brother, it's natural for me to protect you."

The Crown Prince's eyes softened, like melted sugar, his voice even lighter: "Silly brother, I'm the elder brother, it should be me protecting you." He paused, his voice as light as a sigh, "When you collapsed in my arms, I panicked ------

I've never been so scared, afraid you wouldn't wake up, afraid no one would accompany me to drink the osmanthus wine in Xian'an Palace anymore."

Moisture welled up in Zhu Changlan's eyes, like a layer of mist. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, seen battles in the demon world, seen the coldness of human nature, seen his own kind kill each other for spiritual herbs, seen mortals turn against each other for power, but for the first time, he was cherished like this

------ like protecting a warm jade in the heart, afraid of dropping it, afraid of breaking it, afraid of it cooling down.

"Elder Brother,"

Zhu Changlan's voice carried a nasal tone, like a coquettish cat, "When I get better, I'll brew new osmanthus wine for you, using this year's new osmanthus, adding two spoons of honey, like last year."

The Crown Prince smiled, gently flicking his forehead, his movements full of doting: "Okay, I'll wait. When you get better, we'll pick new osmanthus in the Imperial Garden, brew it under the tree in Xian'an Palace, so the whole palace can smell the fragrance."

The sky outside gradually turned white, morning light filtering through the window lattice, falling on their intertwined hands, like sprinkling a layer of crushed gold. Zhu Changlan leaned against the pillow, listening to the Crown Prince's breathing, gradually falling asleep again

In his dream was the magnolia tree in the East Palace, petals falling on his and the Crown Prince's shoulders, warm as an eternal spring. The phantom of his tail curled around his leg, like a warm cloud wrapped around him.
