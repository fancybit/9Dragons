Year 25 of the Wanli Reign, early summer night.

The Xian'an Palace courtyard was bathed in bright moonlight, like a layer of scattered silver. The new leaves of the osmanthus tree in the center of the courtyard gently swayed in the evening breeze, casting dappled shadows on the bluestone slabs, which slowly flowed with the wind. Zhu Changlan wore a moon-white short combat outfit, his cuffs tightly bound, revealing his sleek forearms. He was barefoot, his soles stepping on the cool stone slabs, and the slightly cool evening breeze brushed through his forehead hair, making his clear eyes even brighter.

It had been two months since he returned from Kunlun Mountain. Although the life he had lost hadn't fully recovered, his demon power had gradually stabilized. The spiritual vein spring water and thousand-year-old elixirs sent by Daoist Xuanqing had indeed worked wonders, not only repairing his damaged meridians but also making his demon power more condensed than before. However, every time he circulated his demon power, a faint pain would come from his dantian, reminding him of the danger of the battle with the Black Bone Sect leader that day, and making him dare not slacken for a moment—the escaped remnant soul was like a sword hanging over his head, no one knew when it would return.

"Your Highness, the wooden sword and boxing manual are ready."

Xiaoluzi tiptoed into the courtyard, holding a jet-black wooden sword and a yellowed boxing manual in his arms. The wooden sword was made of阴沉木 (dark wood) from Kunlun Mountain, with a hard texture and moderate weight. It was specially made for him by the Crown Prince according to his hand shape; the boxing manual was a rare copy by a martial arts master from the previous dynasty, which the Crown Prince had found in the library, saying it could help him stabilize his posture and polish his moves.

Zhu Changlan took the wooden sword. It was cool to the touch, with delicate grain. He gently waved it, and the sword cut through the air with a "咻" sound, carrying a steady force. "Thank you for your hard work. Go rest, no need to wait."

"Yes."

Xiaoluzi responded, then reminded, "Your Highness, remember to rest after practicing for a long time. I've warmed ginseng tea in the house, just call me if you're thirsty."

Zhu Changlan nodded in agreement, watching Xiaoluzi's figure disappear at the end of the corridor before turning around, his gaze falling on the open space in the center of the courtyard. The moonlight stretched his shadow long, intertwining with the osmanthus tree's shadow, like a flowing ink painting.

He first opened the boxing manual, carefully studying it by moonlight. The writing on the manual was somewhat blurry, but the annotations of the moves were still clear. Each move emphasized "stability, accuracy, and ruthlessness" while maintaining agility. This boxing manual was different from the demon world's fighting skills; it focused more on the connection between moves and the circulation of internal force, which could just make up for his shortcoming in moves.

In the past, when he fought enemies, he mostly relied on the explosive power of his demon power and flexible body, but his moves were somewhat scattered. Now with this boxing manual, he could integrate his demon power with moves.

"First move, Pine Greeting Guests."

Zhu Changlan softly read the annotation in the boxing manual, his feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, his hands slowly raised, palms facing forward, like a pine tree spreading its branches, his posture steady and relaxed. He took a deep breath, slowly sinking his demon power in his body, flowing along his meridians to his limbs. His demon power was no longer as surging as before, but had become gentle and restrained. With the movement of his moves, it slowly flowed, nourishing his meridians while being able to burst out at any time.

Under the moonlight, his figure was like a pine tree in the wind, sometimes stretching, sometimes tightening. Each move was executed slowly and solidly, with steady force in every punch and kick, yet still agile. He carefully experienced the essence of the boxing manual, feeling the connection point between his demon power and moves, where to exert force, where to retract force, where to turn—all carefully considered in his mind.

When practicing the "Tiger Descending the Mountain" move, he suddenly sank his waist and lowered his stance, his right fist swinging forward with a whooshing sound. The fist wind swept over the ground,卷起 a few fallen leaves, carrying faint golden demon power, making the bluestone slabs vibrate slightly. This punch combined the rigidity of martial arts moves with the grandeur of demon power, more powerful and systematic than his previous attacks relying solely on demon power.

But just then, a sudden pain came from his dantian, like being pricked by a needle. Zhu Changlan's movement paused, his brows slightly furrowed, and a faint trace of blood overflowed from the corner of his mouth. He quickly withdrew his fist, sat cross-legged on the ground, circulating his demon power to soothe the abnormality in his dantian.

"Still too impatient."

He whispered to himself, a hint of helplessness flashing in his eyes. In the battle at Kunlun Mountain, he had exhausted his thousand-year demon power and lost one life. Although he was nourished by elixirs, his dantian was still damaged. If he circulated his demon power too fiercely, it would cause discomfort. The Crown Prince always advised him not to rush, to take it slow, but he knew clearly that as long as the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul was not eliminated, he and the Crown Prince would never be at peace. He must become stronger as soon as possible, strong enough to completely crush any threat, to truly protect the Crown Prince.

After resting for a moment, the pain in his dantian gradually dissipated. Zhu Changlan stood up, picked up the wooden sword beside him, and his fingertips caressed the sword's grain. The wooden sword felt warm and fit his palm perfectly. It was specially customized for him by the Crown Prince, with the right length and weight. He remembered what the Crown Prince had said when giving him the sword: "Ninth Brother, the way of martial arts lies in mental stability, not in seeking quick success. This wooden sword has no edge; it can practice moves without hurting yourself. Practice slowly, I'll wait for you."

The Crown Prince's voice was gentle and firm, like moonlight, calming his anxiety. Zhu Changlan took a deep breath, gripped the wooden sword again, placed the boxing manual aside, and began to practice basic sword techniques from memory.

"Chop, cut, stab, pick, lift, deflect......"

He softly recited the basic moves of swordsmanship, his wrist turning, the wooden sword drawing beautiful arcs in the moonlight. The sword wind howled, carrying faint golden demon power, stirring the surrounding air. The osmanthus leaves were rolled up by the sword wind, spinning in the air, then slowly falling.

At first, his swordsmanship was a bit rusty, the connection between moves not smooth enough, and the use of demon power somewhat stiff. But as he practiced deeper, he gradually found the feeling. Demon power flowed along his arm to the sword, perfectly integrating with the sword moves. Although the wooden sword had no edge, it carried a sharp sword qi, which could easily cut through the air and even leave shallow marks on the stone slabs.

His figure became more agile under the moonlight, like a spirit cat shuttling through the forest. The wooden sword in his hand sometimes moved like a wandering dragon, sometimes like a tiger pouncing, sometimes like a gentle breeze brushing willows, sometimes like thunder exploding. Each move was executed precisely and powerfully, the sword wind howling, interweaving with the evening breeze, making a "呜呜" sound, which was especially clear in the silent courtyard.

When he practiced to the point of enthusiasm, he simply abandoned the constraints of the boxing manual and swordsmanship, integrating the demon world's body techniques with human martial arts moves. His figure shuttled through the courtyard like a ghost, the wooden sword's light flashing like a silver ribbon, cutting the moonlight into countless fragments. His movements became faster and more fierce, golden demon power overflowing from the sword, interweaving with moonlight to form a dazzling light screen, illuminating the entire courtyard.

He didn't know how long he practiced. Fine sweat beads seeped from his forehead, sliding down his cheeks and dripping onto the stone slabs, spreading into small water stains. His combat outfit was soaked with sweat, clinging tightly to his body, outlining his lean yet upright figure. But he didn't stop at all, still immersed in the state of sword practice, his eyes focused and determined, as if the whole world only had him and the wooden sword in his hand.

I. Moonlit Encounter, Crown Prince Watching Sword Practice

"Ninth Brother, it's late at night, are you still practicing sword?"

A familiar gentle voice came from behind, with a hint of a smile. Zhu Changlan's movement paused, the wooden sword "唰" retracting, turning around to look. He saw Crown Prince Zhu Changluo wearing a bright yellow casual robe, standing at the courtyard gate, holding a palace lantern in his hand. The dim light of the lantern made his figure especially warm.

"Elder brother?" Zhu Changlan was a bit surprised, put down the wooden sword, and greeted him, "It's so late, why are you here?"

The Crown Prince walked into the courtyard, placing the palace lantern on the stone table, his gaze falling on Zhu Changlan, his eyes filled with a hint of心疼: "I just finished handling state affairs, thinking you might not have slept yet, so I came to see you. I didn't expect you to still be practicing sword. Look at you sweating all over, come rest."

He picked up the brocade handkerchief on the stone table, handing it to Zhu Changlan: "Wipe your sweat, don't catch a cold."

Zhu Changlan took the brocade handkerchief, wiped the sweat from his forehead, a somewhat embarrassed smile appearing on his face: "I practiced too engrossed, forgot the time."

The Crown Prince sat down on the stone bench, picked up the ginseng tea on the table, handing it to Zhu Changlan: "Xiaoluzi said he warmed ginseng tea for you, drink some to replenish. Your body has just recovered, you can't work so hard."

Zhu Changlan took the ginseng tea, took a sip. The warm ginseng tea slid down his throat, soothing his dry throat and relaxing his tense nerves slightly. "I just want to become stronger as soon as possible." He said softly, his eyes filled with determination, "The Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul is still there, I'm afraid he will come back for revenge. At that time, I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you."

Looking at the worry in his eyes, the Crown Prince felt a warm current in his heart. He reached out, gently patting Zhu Changlan's shoulder: "Silly brother, I know you're worried about me, but you can't joke with your body. You've already done a great job—preserving the spiritual vein source, severely injuring the Black Bone Sect leader and making him flee. All of this is your credit."

He paused, continuing, "The way of martial arts lies in gradual progress, you can't rush. Your current strength is already enough to deal with most dangers. For the rest, we can think of a way together. Moreover, I'm no longer the Crown Prince who needed you to risk your life to protect me. I can also protect you."

Looking at the Crown Prince's determined eyes, the anxiety in Zhu Changlan's heart gradually dissipated. He knew the Crown Prince was right, but he still couldn't help worrying: "But as long as the leader's remnant soul is not eliminated, I won't be at ease. He practices evil techniques, his methods are ruthless. Who knows when he will come back for revenge."

"Don't worry, I've already secretly sent people to track his whereabouts."

The Crown Prince said, "Daoist Xuanqing has also sent Qingyun Temple disciples to search everywhere. Once there's news of him, we'll know immediately. Moreover, we're not fighting alone—righteous cultivators from all over are helping us keep an eye out. Even if he wants to make a comeback, it won't be easy."

He picked up the wooden sword Zhu Changlan had placed aside, gently waving it, the sword wind making a soft sound: "This wooden sword is good, made of阴沉木, hard texture, very suitable for sword practice."

"It's specially customized for me by Elder brother." Zhu Changlan said, with a hint of pride in his tone.

The Crown Prince smiled, handing the wooden sword back to Zhu Changlan: "Since I'm here, why not practice a few more moves for me to see? Let me check your progress over the past two months."

Zhu Changlan nodded, picked up the wooden sword, took a deep breath, and stood in the center of the courtyard again. Under the moonlight, his figure became more upright, his eyes focused and determined. He slowly raised the wooden sword, demon power flowing along his arm to the sword, and the wooden sword glowed with a faint golden light.

"Elder brother, watch carefully."

As the words fell, he suddenly moved. His figure was like an arrow released from a bow, charging forward, the wooden sword cutting through the air with a whooshing sound. His moves were strong and powerful yet agile, each move showing methodical skill. Compared to two months ago, his progress was remarkable.

The Crown Prince sat on the stone bench, quietly watching him practice sword. Moonlight shone on Zhu Changlan, outlining his agile figure. The wooden sword's light flashed like a silver ribbon, interweaving with golden demon power to form a beautiful light screen. His eyes were full of relief, watching Zhu Changlan grow from a timid child to the capable person he was now, feeling both proud and心疼.

He knew that Zhu Changlan's growth had cost him a lot. Battles in the demon world, wandering in the human world, disputes in the deep palace, and the danger of the Kunlun Mountain battle—all these had made him grow rapidly, but also made him bear too much pressure that someone of his age shouldn't bear. But he never complained, just silently endured, working hard to become stronger, only to protect the people he cared about.

II. Move Competition, Brothers United

After Zhu Changlan finished a set of sword techniques, he stood still, his breath slightly hurried, sweat beads again appearing on his forehead. He looked at the Crown Prince, his eyes filled with expectation: "Elder brother, how was it?"

The Crown Prince stood up, walking to his side, smiling and saying: "Great progress. Your moves are much smoother than before, and the compatibility between your demon power and moves has also improved. It seems your hard work over the past two months hasn't been in vain."

He paused, continuing, "However, there are still some areas that can be improved. For example, in the 'lift sword' move, you exerted too much force, leading to poor connection with subsequent moves. Why not try to retract some force, making your demon power more restrained, so that subsequent moves will be more coherent. Also, in 'stab sword', you pursued speed too much, losing precision. You can try slowing down a bit, aiming at the target, then exerting force."

Zhu Changlan listened carefully, remembering the Crown Prince's words one by one. He knew the Crown Prince didn't understand demon power, but he was proficient in martial arts and had a unique vision, always able to point out his shortcomings. "Thank you for your guidance, Elder brother. I'll try again."

He raised the wooden sword again, adjusting his moves according to the Crown Prince's guidance. This time, he no longer pursued speed and power, but focused on the connection and precision of moves. His demon power also became more restrained, flowing slowly along with the moves, just right.

The Crown Prince watched quietly from the side, occasionally opening his mouth to give guidance. Under the moonlight, the two brothers' figures intertwined—one earnestly practicing, one patiently guiding, the atmosphere warm and harmonious.

After practicing for a while, Zhu Changlan gradually found the feeling. His moves became smoother and more precise, the wooden sword's light perfectly matching his demon power, more powerful. He couldn't help but swing a sword toward the Crown Prince, the sword wind howling, carrying faint golden demon power, stabbing toward the air in front of the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince's eyes lit up, his figure flickering, easily avoiding the sword wind. He smiled and said: "Not bad, you've made progress. Since you practice so well, why don't we spar?"

Zhu Changlan was a bit surprised: "Elder brother, do you also know swordsmanship?"

"A little."

The Crown Prince smiled and said, "When I was a child, I learned some from the imperial guards' instructor. Although not as exquisite as yours, I can still practice with you."

He picked up a wooden sword from the weapons rack next to him—also made of阴沉木, exactly the same as Zhu Changlan's. "Come on, don't hold back. Let me see your true strength."

Zhu Changlan nodded, gripping his wooden sword tightly, his eyes becoming focused. He knew the Crown Prince had a good martial arts foundation and was very thoughtful. Sparring with him would be a good test of his progress.

The two stood facing each other, moonlight stretching their shadows long. The courtyard was silent, except for the "沙沙" sound of the evening breeze brushing through the leaves.

"Here I come, Elder brother."

Zhu Changlan whispered, his figure flickering, charging toward the Crown Prince, the wooden sword carrying a fierce sword wind, slashing toward the Crown Prince's shoulder.

The Crown Prince's eyes focused, his wrist turning, the wooden sword precisely blocking Zhu Changlan's attack. "铛"—a clear sound, the two wooden swords collided, sparks flying. The Crown Prince's force was steady, firmly blocking Zhu Changlan's attack, while his wrist turned, the wooden sword sliding down along Zhu Changlan's sword, stabbing toward his wrist.

Zhu Changlan reacted very quickly, his wrist flipping, avoiding the Crown Prince's attack, while his body turned sideways, the wooden sword lifting toward the Crown Prince's waist. The Crown Prince moved his feet, easily avoiding, and the two instantly tangled together.

Under the moonlight, two figures shuttled back and forth, the wooden swords' light flashing, the sword wind howling, interweaving with the evening breeze to form a beautiful light screen. Zhu Changlan's moves were agile and elegant, with the support of demon power, very powerful; the Crown Prince's moves were steady and solid, with tight defense and precise counterattacks. The two exchanged blows, fighting evenly.

Zhu Changlan gradually discovered that the Crown Prince's martial arts attainments were much higher than he imagined. His moves seemed simple but contained endless changes—water-tight in defense, precise and ruthless in counterattack, always able to find his weaknesses when he least expected it. Moreover, the Crown Prince was extremely thoughtful, able to accurately predict his moves and prepare in advance.

"Elder brother, your swordsmanship is really good." Zhu Changlan said while fighting, his tone full of admiration.

The Crown Prince smiled, his wrist turning, the wooden sword blocking Zhu Changlan's attack again: "You're not bad either, progressing quickly. Add more force, let me see your limit."

Zhu Changlan nodded, demon power surging again in his body, his moves becoming more fierce. He exerted the demon world's body techniques to the extreme, his figure shuttling like a ghost, the wooden sword's light flashing like a silver ribbon, launching a fierce attack toward the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince's eyes became more focused, his feet moving faster, the wooden sword waving densely, blocking all of Zhu Changlan's attacks. The two fought more and more fiercely, the sword wind howling, stirring the surrounding air, osmanthus leaves rolled up by the sword wind, flying in the air.

They didn't know how long they fought. Both were a bit out of breath. Zhu Changlan's forehead was covered with sweat, his combat outfit soaked; the Crown Prince's face was also a bit red, his breathing slightly rapid.

"Stop!" The Crown Prince suddenly spoke, retracting his wooden sword and stepping back.

Zhu Changlan also quickly stopped, gasping for breath, looking at the Crown Prince: "Elder brother, what's wrong?"

The Crown Prince smiled and said: "If we continue fighting, we'll both be exhausted. You've done very well—your moves are becoming more exquisite, your use of demon power more proficient."

He paused, continuing, "But you should remember that the way of martial arts doesn't only lie in moves and power, but also in state of mind. A stable mind leads to stable hands; a chaotic mind leads to chaotic hands. No matter how powerful the enemy you encounter, you must stay calm, so that you can exert your true strength."

Zhu Changlan nodded, keeping the Crown Prince's words firmly in mind. He knew the Crown Prince wasn't just teaching him martial arts, but also teaching him the principles of life. "Thank you for your guidance, Elder brother. I remember it."

The two walked to the stone table and sat down. Xiaoluzi quickly brought two cups of warm water. Zhu Changlan drank a sip of water, relieving his dry throat, and his body gradually relaxed.

The Crown Prince looked at him, his eyes full of tenderness: "Ninth Brother, you don't need to put too much pressure on yourself. No matter what danger we encounter, we'll face it together. You're not alone—with me, with Qingyun Temple's Daoists, with all the people who support us, we will definitely defeat any enemy."

Looking at the Crown Prince's determined eyes, Zhu Changlan was filled with emotion. He knew that with the Crown Prince by his side, no matter how difficult the situation, he could face it bravely. "Elder brother, with you here, I'm not afraid of anything."

III. Moonlit Heart-to-Heart, Reminiscing About Past Events

The two sat at the stone table, drinking warm water, chatting. Moonlight shone on them, carrying a faint warmth. The evening breeze blew, bringing the fragrance of osmanthus flowers, the atmosphere warm and pleasant.

"Do you remember when you first learned to write with me?"

The Crown Prince smiled, his eyes full of reminiscence, "You held the brush, couldn't even write steadily, yet you insisted on writing 'Xuanyu' (玄玉). The result was written crookedly, like crawling worms, making me laugh out loud."

Zhu Changlan's cheeks turned slightly red, somewhat embarrassed: "That was when I was a child. How do you remember it so clearly?"

"How could I forget."

The Crown Prince said, "From that moment, I thought you were a stubborn and cute child. Over the years, watching you grow up bit by bit, become stronger bit by bit, I feel both relieved and proud."

He paused, continuing, "I also remember that when you first entered the palace, because you weren't favored, you were often bullied by other princes. Once, the Third Brother snatched your rattle drum and pushed you to the ground. You didn't cry, but got up, stared fiercely at him, and said 'I don't care about your things'. From then on, I made up my mind to protect you well, not letting you be bullied by anyone again."

Zhu Changlan's eyes reddened, tears almost falling. He didn't expect the Crown Prince to remember these old things so clearly. "Elder brother, thank you. If it weren't for you, I'm afraid I wouldn't have survived in this deep palace."

"We are brothers, no thanks needed."

The Crown Prince shook his head, "You protect me, I protect you—it's only natural. Moreover, you've also done a lot for me. In the palace banquet assassination, you were seriously injured to protect me; in the Kunlun Mountain battle, you lost a life to protect the spiritual vein source. I remember all of this."

He looked at Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of sincerity: "Ninth Brother, I know you have many secrets, and that you don't belong to this deep palace. But I want you to know, no matter what your identity is, no matter where you come from, you are my brother Zhu Changluo, the Ninth Prince of the Great Ming. This deep palace will always be your home, and I will always be your elder brother."

Tears finally fell from Zhu Changlan's eyes, sliding down his cheeks. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, seen too much intrigue and betrayal, but never had anyone like the Crown Prince—who treated him so sincerely, who valued him so much. "Elder brother, I will also always protect you, always stay by your side, always be your younger brother."

The Crown Prince reached out, gently wiping his tears: "Good, always be my younger brother."

They chatted for a long time, from childhood anecdotes to court affairs, from the snow scenes under Kunlun Mountain to the water towns of Jiangnan. Zhu Changlan talked about the spiritual spring in the spiritual valley, about the teachings of the white-robed Daoist, about the kind people he met while wandering the human world; the Crown Prince talked about interesting things in the court, about his expectations for the future, about his desire to travel the world with him.

The moonlight gradually slanted westward, the shadows in the courtyard gradually lengthened. Zhu Changlan yawned, his eyes full of sleepiness.

"Go back to sleep." The Crown Prince smiled, "You've been tossing all night, you must be tired."

Zhu Changlan nodded, standing up: "Elder brother, you should also go back to rest early, don't be too tired."

"Okay." The Crown Prince nodded, watching him walk into the room until his figure disappeared at the door before turning to leave.

IV. Late Night Boxing Practice, Demon Power Advancing

Zhu Changlan returned to the room but didn't sleep immediately. He lay on the bed, repeatedly recalling the Crown Prince's guidance and the scene of their sparring, his heart boiling with enthusiasm. He knew he still had a lot of room for improvement and couldn't slack off.

After tossing and turning for a while, he simply got up, put on his combat outfit again, and went to the courtyard. At this time, the moonlight was even brighter, the courtyard was silent, only the evening breeze brushing through the leaves, making a "沙沙" sound.

He walked to the center of the courtyard, took a deep breath, and began to practice boxing again. This time, he no longer obsessed with the precision of moves and the magnitude of force, but focused on the peace of his state of mind. He closed his eyes, setting aside all distracting thoughts, only focusing on his breathing and the circulation of his demon power.

The boxing wind slowly sounded, the moves stretching and steady. Demon power flowed along his meridians, gentle like a stream, yet carrying a steady force. Each move was executed calmly, yet containing endless changes. He could clearly feel that the compatibility between his demon power and moves was getting higher and higher, the pain in his dantian gradually dissipated, replaced by a warm force, nourishing his meridians.

After practicing boxing for a while, he picked up the wooden sword again, starting to practice swordsmanship. This time, his swordsmanship was smoother and more agile, the wooden sword's light perfectly matching his demon power, forming a dazzling light screen. He could feel his demon power slowly advancing, more condensed and easier to control than before.

He didn't know how long he practiced. The sky gradually turned pale. The eastern sky was dyed a faint red, sunlight piercing through the clouds, shining into the courtyard, illuminating the entire courtyard.

Zhu Changlan stood still, taking a deep breath, feeling the demon power surging in his body, his heart full of comfort. After this night's practice, his demon power had advanced a lot, his moves had become more exquisite, and his state of mind had become more peaceful. He knew he was one step closer to becoming stronger, one step closer to protecting the Crown Prince.

He picked up the ginseng tea on the stone table, taking a sip. The warm ginseng tea slid down his throat, soothing his dry throat and completely relaxing his tense nerves. He looked at the rising sun in the east, his eyes full of determination and hope.

V. Morning Practice Encounter, Qingyun Temple Visit

Just as Zhu Changlan was about to go back to the room to rest, he heard footsteps coming from the courtyard gate. He turned around, seeing Daoist Xuanqing leading several Qingyun Temple disciples, standing at the courtyard gate with serious expressions.

"Daoist, why have you come?" Zhu Changlan was a bit surprised, greeting him.

Daoist Xuanqing bowed and saluted: "Greetings to the Ninth Prince. I've come today to report an important matter."

Zhu Changlan's heart sank, quickly saying: "Daoist, please come in, let's talk slowly."

The two entered the room, sitting as host and guest. Xiaoluzi brought tea, then withdrew.

Daoist Xuanqing took a sip of tea, his expression serious: "Ninth Prince, we've found the whereabouts of the Black Bone Sect leader's remnant soul."

Zhu Changlan's eyes instantly became sharp: "Oh? Where is he?"

"He escaped to the Ten Thousand Mountains in the southern border."

Daoist Xuanqing said, "The Ten Thousand Mountains are rich in demon qi, suitable for him to heal and recover. Moreover, there are many Black Bone Sect remnants there. He probably wants to gather his remnants and make a comeback."

Zhu Changlan's fists clenched tightly, a hint of coldness flashing in his eyes: "He's really lucky to have survived this."

"The Black Bone Sect leader's evil technique is extremely诡异. As long as his remnant soul is not destroyed, he can slowly recover."

Daoist Xuanqing said, "The Ten Thousand Mountains have complex terrain and rich demon qi. Our disciples can hardly explore deeply. Moreover, there are many powerful demons there, colluding with the Black Bone Sect leader, their strength should not be underestimated."

Zhu Changlan was silent for a moment, his eyes becoming determined: "No matter where he escapes, I will find him, eliminate him completely, to prevent future troubles."

"Ninth Prince, you mustn't."

Daoist Xuanqing quickly said, "Your body has just recovered, your demon power hasn't fully recovered yet. The Ten Thousand Mountains are too dangerous. If you go there rashly, you might be in danger."

"I've made up my mind."

Zhu Changlan said, "As long as the Black Bone Sect leader is not eliminated, my Elder Brother and I will never be at peace. To protect the spiritual vein source, to protect the Great Ming, to protect my Elder Brother, no matter how dangerous it is, I must go."

Looking at his determined eyes, Daoist Xuanqing knew he couldn't stop him. He sighed, saying: "Since the Ninth Prince has made up his mind, I won't stop you. However, I will send Qingyun Temple disciples to accompany you, to help you. Moreover, please discuss with Crown Prince殿下 carefully, it's best to get his support."

Zhu Changlan nodded: "I will talk to my Elder Brother. Thank you for your support, Daoist."

"Ninth Prince, you're welcome."

Daoist Xuanqing said, "Protecting the righteous path of the human world is the responsibility of Qingyun Temple. Moreover, you and I are destined, I naturally won't stand by and watch."

The two talked for a while longer. Daoist Xuanqing detailed the situation of the Ten Thousand Mountains and the distribution of Black Bone Sect remnants, then left with his disciples.

Zhu Changlan stood in the room, looking at the rising sun outside the window, his eyes full of determination. He knew a new battle was about to begin, the road ahead full of dangers. But he had no fear—for the sake of protecting the people he cared about, for the sake of this hard-won peace, he must forge ahead.

He walked back to the bed, lying down, closing his eyes to rest. In his dreams, he seemed to see the Crown Prince's gentle smile, the spiritual spring in the spiritual valley, the determined eyes of Qingyun Temple disciples. These images, like a warm current, warmed his heart and gave him infinite strength.
