---

In the 25th year of the Wanli era of the Great Ming Dynasty, on a midsummer night.

The courtyard of Tranquility Peace Palace was bathed in moonlight, like a layer of crushed silver spread across the ground. The new leaves of the osmanthus tree in the center of the courtyard swayed gently in the evening breeze, filtering dappled light that fell on the bluestone slabs and slowly shifted with the wind. Zhu Changlan wore a moon-white short martial robe with tightly bound cuffs, revealing his neatly defined forearms. He was barefoot, his soles touching the cool stone slabs, while the slightly cool evening breeze brushed his forehead hair, accentuating the clarity in his eyes.

It had been two months since he returned from Kunlun Mountain. Although the life he had lost hadn't fully recovered, his demonic power had gradually stabilized. The Spirit Vein spring water and thousand-year-old spiritual herbs sent by Daoist Xuanqing were indeed effective, not only repairing his damaged meridians but also making his demonic power more condensed than before. However, every time he circulated his demonic power, he still felt a faint pain in his Dantian, a reminder of the凶险 battle with the Black Bone Sect Leader that day, and a warning not to let his guard down——that escaping remnant soul was like a sword hanging over his head, and no one knew when it would return.

"Your Highness, the wooden sword and boxing manual are ready."

Xiaoluzi entered the courtyard quietly, holding a jet-black wooden sword and a yellowed boxing manual. The wooden sword was made from Kunlun ebony wood, with a hard texture and moderate weight, specially crafted according to his hand size by the Crown Prince; the boxing manual was a unique copy from a renowned martial artist of the previous dynasty, which the Crown Prince had found in the imperial library, saying it would help him stabilize his posture and refine his techniques.

Zhu Changlan took the wooden sword, feeling its cool touch and fine grain. He waved it gently, and the sword cut through the air with a soft "whoosh," carrying a steady force. "Thank you, you can go rest now, no need to wait."

"Yes."

Xiaoluzi responded, then added, "Your Highness, remember to rest if you practice too long. I've warmed ginseng tea in the room; just call if you're thirsty."

Zhu Changlan nodded in agreement, watching Xiaoluzi's figure disappear at the end of the corridor before turning his gaze to the open space in the center of the courtyard. The moonlight stretched his shadow long, interweaving with the osmanthus tree's shadow like a flowing ink painting.

First, he opened the boxing manual and studied it carefully by the moonlight. The characters were somewhat blurred, but the annotations for each move were still legible, each stance emphasizing "stability, precision, and ferocity" while retaining agility. Unlike the demon realm's combat techniques, this boxing manual focused more on the connection between moves and the circulation of internal energy, exactly what he needed to make up for his scattered techniques.

In the past, when facing enemies, he relied mostly on the explosive power of his demonic power and flexible movement, but his techniques were somewhat scattered. Now, with this boxing manual, he could integrate his demonic power with the techniques.

"First form: Pine Greeting Guests."

Zhu Changlan softly recited the annotation from the boxing manual, his feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, his hands slowly raised with palms facing forward, like a pine tree spreading its branches——steady yet graceful. He took a deep breath, guiding his demonic power to slowly sink and circulate through his meridians to his limbs. Instead of the turbulent surge of before, his demonic power became gentle and restrained, flowing slowly with his movements, nourishing his meridians while ready to erupt at any moment.

Under the moonlight, his figure resembled a pine tree in the wind, now extending, now contracting. Each move was slow and solid, every punch and kick carrying steady force yet retaining agility. He carefully experienced the essence of the boxing manual, sensing the connection between his demonic power and the techniques——where to exert force, where to retract, where to turn, all carefully considered in his mind.

When he reached the "Tiger Descending the Mountain"

move, he suddenly lowered his waist and sank into a horse stance, his right fist cutting through the air with a whistle of wind. The fist wind swept across the ground, lifting several fallen leaves, carrying a faint golden demonic power that made the stone slabs vibrate slightly. This punch combined the firmness of martial arts techniques with the power of demonic energy, more powerful and structured than his previous attacks relying solely on demonic power.

But just then, a sharp pain suddenly pierced his Dantian, like a needle prick. Zhu Changlan's movements froze, his brow furrowed slightly, and a faint trace of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth. He quickly retracted his fist, sat cross-legged on the ground, circulating his demonic power to soothe the disturbance in his Dantian.

"Still too impatient."

He whispered to himself, a trace of helplessness flashing in his eyes. In the battle on Kunlun Mountain, he had exhausted his thousand-year demonic power and lost a life. Although nourished by spiritual herbs, his Dantian was still damaged. If he pushed his demonic power too hard, it would cause discomfort. The Crown Prince always advised him not to rush, to take his time, but he knew clearly that as long as the Black Bone Sect Leader's remnant soul remained, he and the Crown Prince would never be truly safe. He had to become stronger as soon as possible, strong enough to completely crush any threat, to truly protect the Crown Prince.

After resting for a moment, the faint pain in his Dantian gradually subsided. Zhu Changlan stood up, picked up the wooden sword beside him, and ran his fingertips along the sword's grain. The sword felt warm and fit perfectly in his palm, specially customized by the Crown Prince with the exact length and weight that suited him. He remembered what the Crown Prince had said when giving him the sword: "Ninth Brother, the way of martial arts lies in a steady heart, not seeking quick success. This sword has no blade, so it can practice techniques without harming yourself. Practice slowly; I'll wait for you."

The Crown Prince's voice was gentle yet firm, like moonlight calming his restless heart. Zhu Changlan took a deep breath, tightened his grip on the wooden sword, placed the boxing manual aside, and began practicing basic sword techniques from memory.

"Chop, cut, thrust, lift, slice, parry..."

He softly recited the basic sword moves, his wrist turning as the wooden sword traced graceful arcs in the moonlight. The sword wind howled, carrying a faint golden demonic power that stirred the air around him. Osmanthus leaves were lifted by the sword wind, swirling in the air before slowly falling.

At first, his sword techniques were a bit rusty, with awkward transitions between moves and stiff application of demonic power. But as he continued practicing, he gradually found his rhythm. His demonic power flowed along his arm to the sword, perfectly matching his techniques. Although the sword had no blade, it carried a sharp sword energy that could easily cut through the air and even leave shallow marks on the stone slabs.

His figure became more agile under the moonlight, like a spirit cat moving through the forest. The wooden sword in his hand sometimes moved like a swimming dragon, sometimes like a pouncing tiger, sometimes like a gentle breeze brushing willow branches, sometimes like a thunderclap. Each move was precise and powerful, the sword wind howling and interweaving with the evening breeze, producing a "woo-woo" sound that echoed clearly in the quiet courtyard.

When he became fully immersed in the practice, he completely abandoned the constraints of the boxing manual and sword techniques, integrating the demon realm's movement with mortal martial arts. His figure darted through the courtyard like a ghost, the silver light of the wooden sword cutting through the moonlight into countless pieces. His movements became faster and more fierce, golden demonic power overflowing from the sword and interweaving with the moonlight, forming a dazzling light curtain that illuminated the entire courtyard.

He didn't know how long he practiced, but sweat beads began to form on his forehead, sliding down his cheeks and dripping onto the stone slabs, creating small water stains. His martial robe was soaked with sweat, clinging tightly to his body, outlining his lean yet upright figure. But he showed no signs of stopping, still completely absorbed in his sword practice, his eyes focused and determined, as if the entire world only contained him and the wooden sword in his hand.

### I. Moonlit Encounter, Crown Prince Watches Sword Practice

"Ninth Brother, it's late, still practicing sword?"

A familiar, gentle voice came from behind, carrying a hint of a smile. Zhu Changlan's movements froze, and the wooden sword made a "whoosh" sound as he retracted it, turning to look. There stood Crown Prince Zhu Changluo in a bright yellow casual robe, holding a palace lantern in his hand. The dim light cast a warm glow over his figure.

"Elder Brother?" Zhu Changlan was surprised, put down the wooden sword, and greeted him, "It's so late, why are you here?"

The Crown Prince entered the courtyard, placed the palace lantern on the stone table, and his gaze fell on Zhu Changlan, his eyes filled with concern: "I just finished handling court affairs and thought you might still be awake, so I came to check. I didn't expect you to still be practicing sword. Look at you, soaked in sweat, come rest."

He picked up a brocade handkerchief from the stone table and handed it to Zhu Changlan: "Wipe your sweat, don't catch a cold."

Zhu Changlan took the handkerchief and wiped his forehead, a faint smile of embarrassment on his face: "I was too absorbed in practice and lost track of time."

The Crown Prince sat down on a stone stool, picked up the ginseng tea from the table, and handed it to Zhu Changlan: "Xiaoluzi said he warmed ginseng tea for you, drink some to replenish your energy. Your body has just recovered, you can't push yourself like this."

Zhu Changlan took the ginseng tea and took a sip. The warm tea slid down his throat, soothing his dry throat and relaxing his tense nerves. "I just want to become stronger quickly," he said softly, his eyes filled with determination, "The Black Bone Sect Leader's remnant soul is still out there; I'm afraid he'll come back for revenge. When that happens, I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you."

The Crown Prince looked at the concern in his eyes, a warm feeling welling up in his heart. He reached out and patted Zhu Changlan's shoulder: "Silly brother, I know you're worried about me, but you can't joke with your health. You've already done well——the Spirit Vein Source was preserved, and the Black Bone Sect Leader fled with serious injuries. That's all your doing."

He paused, then continued: "The way of martial arts is gradual; you can't rush it. Your current strength is already sufficient to handle most dangers, and we can figure out the rest together. Besides, I'm no longer the Crown Prince who needed you to protect me with your life; I can also protect you now."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince's determined eyes, and his restlessness gradually dissipated. He knew the Crown Prince was right, but he still couldn't help worrying: "But as long as that Leader's remnant soul isn't eliminated, I won't be at ease. He practices evil arts and is ruthless; who knows when he'll come back for revenge?"

"Don't worry, I've already had people secretly tracking his whereabouts," the Crown Prince said, "Daoist Xuanqing has also sent Azure Cloud Temple disciples to search everywhere. As soon as there's news of him, we'll know immediately. And we're not fighting alone——Righteous cultivators from all over are helping us keep watch. Even if he wants to make a comeback, it won't be easy."

He picked up the wooden sword Zhu Changlan had placed aside and waved it gently, the sword wind making a soft sound: "This wooden sword is nice, made from ebony wood with a hard texture, perfect for practicing swordsmanship."

"It was specially customized for me by Elder Brother," Zhu Changlan said, a hint of pride in his tone.

The Crown Prince smiled and handed the sword back to him: "Since I'm here, why not practice a few more moves for me? Let me see your progress in these two months."

Zhu Changlan nodded, took the wooden sword, took a deep breath, and stood in the center of the courtyard again. Under the moonlight, his figure became even more挺拔, his eyes focused and determined. He slowly raised the wooden sword, his demonic power flowing along his arm to the sword, which glowed with a faint golden light.

"Elder Brother, watch carefully."

As the words fell, he suddenly moved. His figure shot forward like an arrow released from a bow, the wooden sword howling through the air, chopping at the air. His moves were powerful yet agile, each one showing structure and章法, a significant improvement from two months ago.

The Crown Prince sat on the stone stool, watching him quietly. Moonlight fell on Zhu Changlan, outlining his agile figure, the silver light of the wooden sword interweaving with golden demonic power to form a beautiful light curtain. His eyes were filled with relief, watching Zhu Changlan grow from a timid child to someone who could stand on his own, feeling both proud and心疼.

He knew Zhu Changlan's growth had come at a great cost. Battles in the demon realm, wandering in the mortal world, palace intrigue, and the凶险 battle on Kunlun Mountain——all these had made him grow rapidly, but also forced him to bear pressures no one his age should have to bear. Yet he never complained, only silently endured and worked hard to become stronger, all to protect the people he cared about.

### II. Technique Exchange, Brothers United

After completing a set of sword techniques, Zhu Changlan stopped, his breathing slightly rapid, sweat beads again forming on his forehead. He looked at the Crown Prince, his eyes filled with anticipation: "Elder Brother, how was that?"

The Crown Prince stood up and walked over, smiling: "Great progress. Your moves are much smoother than before, and your demonic power matches your techniques much better. Your hard work these two months hasn't been in vain."

He paused, then continued: "However, there are still areas for improvement. For example, in the 'slice sword' move, you exert too much force, causing the subsequent moves to be disconnected. Try pulling back a little, making your demonic power more restrained, and your subsequent moves will be more coherent. Also, for the 'thrust sword', you're too focused on speed, losing precision. You can try slowing down a bit, aim at your target, then exert force."

Zhu Changlan listened attentively, committing the Crown Prince's words to memory. He knew the Crown Prince didn't understand demonic power, but he was well-versed in martial arts and had a keen eye, always able to point out his weaknesses. "Thank you for your guidance, Elder Brother, I'll try again."

He raised the wooden sword again, adjusting his techniques according to the Crown Prince's advice. This time, he no longer pursued speed and power, but focused on the connection between moves and precision. His demonic power became more restrained, flowing gently with his movements, just right.

The Crown Prince watched quietly from the side, occasionally offering a few pointers. Under the moonlight, the two brothers' figures intertwined, one practicing earnestly, the other guiding patiently——a warm and harmonious scene.

After practicing for a while, Zhu Changlan gradually found his rhythm. His moves became more fluid, his precision improved, and the sword light perfectly matched his demonic power, making it even more powerful. He couldn't help but swing a sword at the Crown Prince, the sword wind howling, carrying a faint golden demonic power, thrusting at the air in front of the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince's eyes lit up, his figure flashing aside easily to avoid the sword wind. He smiled and said: "Not bad, you're making progress. Since you're doing so well, why don't we spar?"

Zhu Changlan was surprised: "Elder Brother, do you know swordsmanship too?"

"A little," the Crown Prince smiled, "I learned some from the imperial guards' instructor when I was young. Not as proficient as you, but I can still practice with you."

He picked up a wooden sword from the weapon rack nearby, also made from ebony wood, identical to Zhu Changlan's. "Come on, don't hold back, let me see your real strength."

Zhu Changlan nodded, tightening his grip on the wooden sword, his eyes becoming focused. He knew the Crown Prince had a good martial arts foundation and was meticulous in his thinking; sparring with him would be the perfect way to test his progress.

The two stood facing each other, their shadows stretched long by the moonlight. The courtyard was silent, except for the "rustle" of wind through the leaves.

"Here I come, Elder Brother."

Zhu Changlan whispered, his figure darting forward, the wooden sword cutting through the air with a sharp wind, chopping at the Crown Prince's shoulder.

The Crown Prince's eyes narrowed, his wrist turning, the wooden sword precisely blocking Zhu Changlan's attack. "Ding!" The two wooden swords collided, producing a clear sound and sparks. The Crown Prince's strength was steady, firmly blocking Zhu Changlan's attack, while his wrist turned, the sword sliding along Zhu Changlan's blade, thrusting toward his wrist.

Zhu Changlan reacted quickly, flipping his wrist to avoid the attack, while leaning to the side, the wooden sword slicing toward the Crown Prince's waist. The Crown Prince moved his feet, easily avoiding it, and the two immediately engaged in a fierce spar.

Under the moonlight, the two figures moved back and forth, the wooden swords flashing with light, the sword wind howling and interweaving with the evening breeze to form a beautiful light curtain. Zhu Changlan's moves were agile and elegant, enhanced by his demonic power; the Crown Prince's moves were steady and solid, with tight defense and precise counterattacks. The two exchanged blows, neither able to gain the upper hand.

Zhu Changlan gradually discovered that the Crown Prince's martial arts attainments were much higher than he had imagined. His moves seemed simple, but contained infinite variations, his defense impenetrable, and his counterattacks precise and ruthless, always able to find his flaws at the right moment. Moreover, the Crown Prince was extremely meticulous, able to accurately predict his moves and prepare in advance.

"Elder Brother, your swordsmanship is really impressive," Zhu Changlan said while fighting, his tone filled with admiration.

The Crown Prince smiled, his wrist turning to block Zhu Changlan's attack again: "You're not bad either, making good progress. Put a little more force into it, let me see your limit."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his demonic power surging again, his moves becoming more fierce. He exerted the demon realm's movement to its limit, his figure darting like a ghost, the silver light of the wooden sword flashing like a silver chain, launching a fierce attack on the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince's eyes became more focused, his movements faster, his wooden sword moving airtight, blocking all of Zhu Changlan's attacks. The two fought more intensely, the sword wind howling, stirring the air around them, osmanthus leaves being lifted by the wind and swirling in the air.

After fighting for an unknown time, both were breathing heavily. Sweat covered Zhu Changlan's forehead, his martial robe completely soaked; the Crown Prince's face was flushed, his breathing slightly uneven.

"Stop!" The Crown Prince suddenly spoke, retracting his sword and stepping back.

Zhu Changlan also quickly stopped, gasping, looking at the Crown Prince: "Elder Brother, what's wrong?"

The Crown Prince smiled and said: "If we keep fighting, we'll both collapse from exhaustion. You've done very well——your moves are becoming more refined, and your use of demonic power is becoming more skilled."

He paused, then continued: "However, remember that the way of martial arts is not just about techniques and strength, but also about state of mind. A steady mind leads to steady hands; a chaotic mind leads to chaotic hands. No matter how powerful your enemy is, you must stay calm, only then can you display your true strength."

Zhu Changlan nodded, keeping the Crown Prince's words firmly in his heart. He knew the Crown Prince wasn't just teaching him martial arts, but also the principles of life. "Thank you for your guidance, Elder Brother, I'll remember that."

The two walked to the stone table and sat down, Xiaoluzi quickly bringing two cups of warm water. Zhu Changlan took a sip, relieving his dry throat and gradually relaxing his body.

The Crown Prince looked at him, his eyes filled with tenderness: "You don't have to put too much pressure on yourself. No matter what danger we face, we'll face it together. You're not alone——I'm here, Daoist Xuanqing is here, and all the people who support us are here. We will definitely overcome any enemy."

Zhu Changlan looked at the Crown Prince's determined eyes, his heart filled with gratitude. He knew that with the Crown Prince by his side, no matter how difficult things got, he could face them bravely. "With you here, Elder Brother, I'm not afraid of anything."

### III. Moonlit Conversation, Reminiscing About the Past

The two sat at the stone table, drinking warm water and chatting. Moonlight fell on them, bringing a faint warmth, while the evening breeze carried the scent of osmanthus, creating a warm and comfortable atmosphere.

"Do you remember when you first learned to write with me?" The Crown Prince asked with a smile, his eyes filled with nostalgia, "You held the brush, couldn't even write steadily, yet you insisted on writing 'Xuan Yu' (玄玉), and the result was so crooked it looked like crawling worms, which made me laugh out loud."

Zhu Changlan's cheeks reddened slightly, somewhat embarrassed: "That was when we were kids, how do you still remember that so clearly?"

"How could I forget?" The Crown Prince said, "From that moment on, I thought you were a stubborn yet lovely child. All these years, watching you grow up and become stronger bit by bit, I've felt both relieved and proud."

He paused, then continued: "I also remember when you first entered the palace, because you weren't favored, you were often bullied by other princes. Once, the Third Brother stole your rattle drum and pushed you to the ground, but you didn't cry. Instead, you got up, glared at him fiercely, and said 'I don't care about your things.' From that day on, I decided I would definitely protect you well, so you would never be bullied again."

Tears welled up in Zhu Changlan's eyes, nearly spilling over. He never expected the Crown Prince to remember these old memories so clearly. "Thank you, Elder Brother. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have survived in this deep palace until today."

"We're brothers; no need for thanks," the Crown Prince shook his head, "You protect me, and I protect you——that's only natural. Moreover, you've done so much for me: at the palace banquet assassination, you took a serious injury to protect me; in the Kunlun Mountain battle, you lost a life to protect the Spirit Vein Source. I remember all of that."

He looked at Zhu Changlan, his eyes full of sincerity: "Ninth Brother, I know you have many secrets, and I know you don't belong in this deep palace. But I want you to know that no matter what your identity is, no matter where you come from, you are always my brother Zhu Changluo's brother, the Ninth Prince of the Great Ming Wanli Emperor. This deep palace will always be your home, and I will always be your Elder Brother."

Tears finally rolled down Zhu Changlan's cheeks. He had lived for nearly a thousand years, seen too much intrigue and betrayal, yet no one had ever treated him with such sincerity and care. "Elder Brother, I will always protect you, always stay by your side, always be your brother."

The Crown Prince reached out and gently wiped his tears: "Good, always be my brother."

They chatted for a long time, from childhood anecdotes to court affairs, from the snow scenery at the foot of Kunlun Mountain to the water towns of Jiangnan. Zhu Changlan talked about the Spirit Spring in the Spirit Valley, the teachings of the White-robed Daoist, and the kind people he met while wandering the mortal world; the Crown Prince talked about interesting things in the court, his hopes for the future, and his desire to travel the rivers and lakes with him.

The moon gradually moved westward, and the shadows in the courtyard lengthened. Zhu Changlan yawned, his eyes filled with exhaustion.

"Go back to sleep," the Crown Prince said with a smile, "You've been up all night; you must be tired."

Zhu Changlan nodded and stood up: "Elder Brother, you should also go back to rest early, don't overwork yourself."

"I will," the Crown Prince nodded, watching Zhu Changlan enter the house, not leaving until his figure disappeared at the door.

### IV. Late-Night Boxing Practice, Demonic Power Advancing

Returning to his room, Zhu Changlan didn't fall asleep immediately. He lay in bed, his mind repeatedly replaying the Crown Prince's guidance and their sparring scene, his blood boiling with excitement. He knew he still had much room for improvement, and he couldn't afford to slack off.

After tossing and turning for a while, he got up, changed back into his martial robe, and returned to the courtyard. By now, the moonlight was even brighter, and the courtyard was silent, with only the "rustle" of wind through the leaves.

He walked to the center of the courtyard, took a deep breath, and began practicing boxing again. This time, he no longer obsessed over the precision of his moves or the strength he exerted, but focused on calming his mind. He closed his eyes, letting go of all distractions, only focusing on his breathing and the circulation of his demonic power.

The sound of fists cutting through the air gradually rose, his moves graceful and steady. His demonic power flowed along his meridians, gentle like a stream yet carrying continuous strength. Each move was performed calmly and leisurely, yet contained infinite variations. He could clearly feel that his demonic power was becoming more aligned with his moves, the faint pain in his Dantian gradually dissipating, replaced by a warm power nourishing his meridians.

After practicing boxing for a while, he picked up the wooden sword again, practicing sword techniques. This time, his swordsmanship was more fluid and agile, the sword light perfectly matching his demonic power, forming a dazzling light curtain. He could feel his demonic power slowly advancing, becoming more condensed and easier to control than before.

He didn't know how long he practiced until the sky gradually turned pale in the east. The eastern sky was dyed a faint red, and sunlight filtered through the clouds, illuminating the courtyard.

Zhu Changlan stopped, took a deep breath, feeling the demonic power surging within him, his heart filled with relief. Through this night of practice, his demonic power had advanced further, his techniques had become more refined, and his state of mind had become more peaceful. He knew he was one step closer to becoming stronger, one step closer to protecting the Crown Prince.

He picked up the ginseng tea from the stone table and took a sip. The warm tea slid down his throat, soothing his dry throat and completely relaxing his tense nerves. He looked at the rising sun in the east, his eyes filled with determination and hope.

### V. Morning Practice Encounter, Azure Cloud Temple Visits

Just as Zhu Changlan was about to return to his room to rest, he heard footsteps at the courtyard door. Turning to look, he saw Daoist Xuanqing leading several Azure Cloud Temple disciples, standing at the courtyard door with serious expressions.

"Daoist, why are you here?" Zhu Changlan was surprised and greeted him.

Daoist Xuanqing bowed respectfully: "Greetings, Ninth Prince. I've come today to report an important matter."

A sinking feeling arose in Zhu Changlan's heart, and he quickly said: "Please come in, Daoist, let's talk inside."

The two entered the room and sat down as guests. Xiaoluzi served tea and then withdrew.

After taking a sip of tea, Daoist Xuanqing said gravely: "Ninth Prince, we've found the whereabouts of the Black Bone Sect Leader's remnant soul."

Zhu Changlan's eyes instantly sharpened: "Oh? Where is he?"

"He fled to the Ten Thousand Great Mountains in the southern border," Daoist Xuanqing said, "The Ten Thousand Great Mountains are filled with demonic energy, suitable for him to recover from his injuries. Moreover, there are many Black Bone Sect remnants there; he likely intends to gather them and make a comeback."

Zhu Changlan's fists clenched tightly, a cold glint in his eyes: "He's quite lucky to have survived that."

"The Black Bone Sect Leader practices extremely strange evil arts," Daoist Xuanqing explained, "As long as his remnant soul remains, he can slowly recover. The Ten Thousand Great Mountains have complex terrain and浓郁 demonic energy, making it difficult for our disciples to investigate deeply. Furthermore, there are many powerful demon creatures there who have formed alliances with the Black Bone Sect Leader, so their strength shouldn't be underestimated."

Zhu Changlan was silent for a moment, his eyes becoming determined: "No matter where he flees, I will find him and eliminate him completely to prevent future trouble."

"Ninth Prince, please don't act recklessly," Daoist Xuanqing hurriedly said, "Your body has just recovered, and your demonic power hasn't fully stabilized yet. The Ten Thousand Great Mountains are too dangerous; if you go there rashly, you'll be in great danger."

"I've made up my mind," Zhu Changlan said, "As long as the Black Bone Sect Leader's remnant soul isn't eliminated, the Crown Prince and I will never be safe. To protect the Spirit Vein Source, to protect the Great Ming Dynasty, and to protect the Crown Prince, I'll go even if it's dangerous."

Daoist Xuanqing looked at his determined eyes, knowing he couldn't stop him. He sighed and said: "Since the Ninth Prince has made up his mind, I won't stop you. However, I'll send Azure Cloud Temple disciples to accompany you to assist. Also, please carefully consider this with the Crown Prince; it's best to have his support."

Zhu Changlan nodded: "I will talk to the Crown Prince. Thank you for your support, Daoist."

"You're welcome, Ninth Prince," Daoist Xuanqing said, "Protecting the mortal realm's righteous path is the responsibility of Azure Cloud Temple. Moreover, you and I are destined, so I naturally won't stand by and do nothing."

The two chatted for a while longer, Daoist Xuanqing detailing the situation in the Ten Thousand Great Mountains and the distribution of Black Bone Sect remnants before leaving with his disciples.

Zhu Changlan stood in the room, looking at the rising sun outside the window, his eyes filled with determination. He knew a new battle was about to begin, and the road ahead was full of dangers. But he had no fear——for the people he cared about, for this hard-won peace, he had to move forward bravely.

He returned to his bed, closed his eyes, and began to rest. He needed to conserve his energy, preparing for the upcoming battle. In his dreams, he seemed to see the Crown Prince's gentle smile, the Spirit Spring in the Spirit Valley, and the determined eyes of the Azure Cloud Temple disciples. These images warmed his heart like a stream, giving him infinite strength.

--- End of Chapter 8 ---
