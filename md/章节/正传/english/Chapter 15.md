# Chapter 15: Seriously Injured, Secretly Refining the Spirit Fruit

It was already late at night when the palace gates of Xian'an Palace were forcefully pushed open.

Several Jinyiwei carried a stretcher, hurrying inside. Leading them was Xiaoluzi, his face as white as a sheet, shouting as he ran: "Quick! Quick! The Prince is injured!" The palace attendants quickly moved aside upon hearing this. Some rushed to report to Emperor Zhu Youxiao, while others fetched clean bedding and medicine. Xian'an Palace instantly descended into chaos.

Zhu Youxiao had just arrived from Qianqing Palace and was standing at the entrance of the side hall. Upon seeing this, he immediately stepped forward: "What happened? Wasn't Ninth Uncle perfectly fine when he left the palace this morning?"

The Jinyiwei leader carrying the stretcher had bloodstains all over his face. He knelt on one knee: "Your Majesty, Ninth Prince went to Xishan today to investigate spirit vein abnormalities. On the way back, he was ambushed. The attackers disguised themselves as us, poisoned the tea in advance, weakening His Highness's strength, and then suddenly attacked at night. We fought desperately to protect the Prince and break through, but the attackers were too strong. His Highness blocked three attacks to cover our retreat, and finally fell unconscious from severe injuries."

Daoist Xuan Chen followed closely, taking a dust whisk from his sleeve: "First, carry the Prince to the soft couch so贫道 can check his pulse."

The Jinyiwei quickly carried Zhu Changlan to the soft couch in the inner chamber. Moonlight filtered through the carved window lattice, illuminating Zhu Changlan's pale face. His brows were tightly furrowed, a trace of black blood still remaining at the corner of his mouth. His stone-blue brocade robe was torn to shreds, revealing several deep bone-deep wounds. The areas around the wounds were tinged with a strange black color, clearly indicating he had been poisoned by demon toxin.

Daoist Xuan Chen stepped forward to check his pulse. As soon as his fingers touched Zhu Changlan's wrist, he drew in a cold breath: "What a domineering poison! This is the Black Bone Sect's 'Bone-Eroding Powder,' specifically designed to counteract the bloodline power of demon cultivators. Combined with the evil aura contained in those wounds, it has already invaded the Prince's five internal organs."

Zhu Youxiao paced back and forth anxiously: "Does the Daoist have a way to treat him? Won't Ninth Uncle be in danger?"

Daoist Xuan Chen took out a cyan pill and fed it to Zhu Changlan: "This is Qingyun Temple's 'Pure Heart Detoxification Pill,' which can temporarily suppress the poison. However, to completely detoxify, we either need to find the Black Bone Sect's antidote or use the Prince's own demon power to refine it. But His Highness's natal spirit bead seems to be operating on its own, absorbing the evil aura. This is a good sign."

Following Daoist Xuan Chen's gaze, Zhu Youxiao saw that Ninth Uncle's chest衣襟 was slightly bulging, with a faint golden glow emanating from it—this was his natal spirit bead. It was a circular golden bead with a miniature projection of the Tree of Life and a Horus Eye pattern inside, a heritage treasure of the Snow Spirit Cat clan.

"I'll go fetch the imperial physician!" Zhu Youxiao turned to leave, but was stopped by Daoist Xuan Chen: "Your Majesty, this matter should not be made public. The Black Bone Sect dared to ambush Ninth Uncle within the capital, which means they have already infiltrated the imperial palace. Calling the imperial physician would only alert the enemy and might lead to further tampering.贫道 suggests publicly announcing that Ninth Uncle is severely injured and needs to rest, and temporarily not letting too many people know the details."

Zhu Youxiao nodded: "What the Daoist says makes perfect sense. Then I'll trouble the Daoist to stay in Xian'an Palace and treat Ninth Uncle. I'll send people to strictly guard Xian'an Palace, not allowing anyone to enter or exit casually."

Daoist Xuan Chen bowed: "Your Majesty, rest assured.贫道 will do everything in my power."

Meanwhile, Zhu Changlan's consciousness was exceptionally clear despite his unconscious state.

He seemed to be in a golden space, surrounded by dense spiritual mist. His natal spirit bead floated before him, and the projection of the Tree of Life inside was slowly rotating, each leaf emitting a soft golden light. He could feel a strange power flowing into his body from his wounds—that was the spirit fruit power contained in the Black Bone Sect's demon poison.

It turned out that to enhance the poison's power, the Black Bone Sect had added a precious spiritual material called "Millennium Spirit Fruit" to it. This spirit fruit was originally used to enhance the strength of demon cultivators, but after being refined into poison by the Black Bone Sect, it became a deadly weapon. However, for Zhu Changlan, who possessed a natal spirit bead, this was an opportunity.

Zhu Changlan remembered that not long ago he had obtained the Xuan Yu Miao Dao, with the Big Dipper decoration carved on the blade, containing Horus Eye energy. During his confrontation with the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord, his natal spirit bead had resonated with the Xuan Yu Miao Dao, displaying powerful purification ability. At this moment, the natal spirit bead was once again发挥作用, absorbing the spirit fruit power from the demon poison while purifying the evil aura within.

He attempted to circulate his internal demon power, guiding the natal spirit bead to absorb the spirit fruit power. Following his guidance, the spirit fruit power continuously poured into the natal spirit bead. The projection of the Tree of Life became clearer and clearer, each leaf sparkling with golden light, as if it were alive.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhu Changlan suddenly felt a cool sensation spreading from his dantian. His wounds began to heal, and the demon poison in his body gradually dissipated. At the same time, his senses became increasingly acute—he could hear sounds from the outside world and even see the surrounding scenes.

He knew that this was his cat demon instincts recovering. As a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat, he originally had night vision, a keen sense of smell, and agile movements. However, because he had long disguised himself as a human, these instincts had been suppressed. Now, with the refinement of the spirit fruit power, these instincts were gradually awakening.

"Your Majesty, the Prince's pulse is becoming more stable." Daoist Xuan Chen's voice reached his ears. "The natal spirit bead has already absorbed most of the spirit fruit power and is purifying the final evil aura."

"That's good, that's good." Zhu Youxiao's voice was filled with relief. "Ninth Uncle has a blessed destiny; he'll definitely be fine."

Zhu Changlan continued to immerse himself in cultivation. He could feel that the connection between his natal spirit bead and the Tree of Life was growing closer, as if an invisible bond was connecting them. The complete form of the Tree of Life appeared in his mind, each sephirah emitting a different light, corresponding one by one to the Major Arcana of the tarot deck.

Just then, Xiaoluzi's voice came from outside: "Your Majesty, there's an iron smith named 'Lao Tietou' requesting an audience. He claims to be an old acquaintance of Ninth Uncle. Upon hearing that Ninth Uncle is severely injured, he specially came to visit."

"Lao Tietou?" Zhu Youxiao was stunned for a moment, then remembered that Ninth Uncle had mentioned this name before—the blacksmith who forged the Xuan Yu Miao Dao. "Quickly, invite him in."

Soon, a elderly man in rough cloth clothing with a wrinkled face walked in—it was Lao Tietou. He carried a cloth package containing some herbs and medicine.

"Greetings, Your Majesty, greetings to Daoist Xuan Chen." Lao Tietou bowed, his gaze falling on Zhu Changlan. His brow furrowed: "The Prince's injury looks quite serious."

"Indeed, very serious." Zhu Youxiao sighed. "But Daoist Xuan Chen said that Ninth Uncle's natal spirit bead is healing itself, so he should be fine."

Lao Tietou approached the soft couch, carefully observing the natal spirit bead on Zhu Changlan's chest. A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes: "I never expected that the Prince's natal spirit bead would have such power. After the tarot fortune-teller read my fortune, I didn't immediately believe it. I found a local Taoist to do a Zhouyi divination for me, and I got the Qian hexagram, with the hexagram statement 'Yuan Heng Li Zhen.' I thought it was an auspicious hexagram, but the Taoist said that the last line of the Qian hexagram is 'Kang Long You Hui' (Arrogant dragon regrets), warning me that 'fullness cannot last long,' advising me to make early preparations for retirement."

Upon hearing this, Daoist Xuan Chen nodded: "The Qian hexagram represents heaven, symbolizing strength, integrity, and purity. But 'Kang Long You Hui' is indeed a warning, meaning that when a dragon flies too high, it will inevitably regret it. This is also a reminder to the Prince to avoid arrogance and regret, not to be too radical in everything, and to make early preparations, leaving a way out."

Daoist Xuan Chen took out a yellowed Zhouyi ancient book from his sleeve, flipping to the hexagram statement of the Qian hexagram: "'Kang Long You Hui, fullness cannot last long.' Indeed. The Prince has been too sharp these days, which has inevitably attracted trouble."

He closed the ancient book, then took out three copper coins and said: "Why don't贫道 cast a divination for the Prince to see his future?" With that, he shook the copper coins in his hand and threw them on the table.

Both Zhu Youxiao and Lao Tietou leaned in to look. The three copper coins landed showing one yang and two yin lines.

"This is the lower hexagram, Zhen (Thunder)." Daoist Xuan Chen explained, then picked up the copper coins, shook them again, and threw them on the table. This time, the coins landed showing one yin, one yang, and one yin line.

"The upper hexagram is Kan (Water)." Daoist Xuan Chen opened the ancient book, pointing to the hexagram image of Tun (Difficulty at the Beginning), saying: "Lower Zhen and upper Kan, this is the Tun hexagram. The hexagram statement is: 'Tun, Yuan Heng Li Zhen, do not act rashly, if you have a direction, it is beneficial to establish a lord.' The Tun hexagram represents difficulties and obstacles. 'Do not act rashly' means it is not appropriate to act impulsively. 'If you have a direction, it is beneficial to establish a lord' means that although there are obstacles, as long as the direction is correct, you can achieve great things."

He explained: "The hexagram image of Tun is lower Zhen and upper Kan, with Zhen representing thunder and Kan representing water. Thunder melts ice, and all things复苏, but it also means difficulties ahead. This hexagram indicates that although the Prince is currently encountering difficulties, as long as he maintains a stable mindset, adjusts his plans, and accumulates strength, he can turn danger into safety and achieve great achievements."

"Well said." Lao Tietou nodded. "The Tun hexagram has another key meaning: 'encountering difficulties just as you start to exert yourself after full preparation.' Recently, the Prince just obtained the Xuan Yu Miao Dao, his strength improved, and he was about to show his talents, only to encounter the Black Bone Sect's ambush. This is exactly the precise prediction of the Tun hexagram. But the Tun hexagram is not just a warning, it is also an encouragement—when encountering such situations, one must not be impatient or impulsive, nor should one become discouraged. Prince, you must maintain a stable mindset, adjust your plans, temporarily lie low and accumulate strength, and then take action when the time is right. Only then can you turn danger into safety and overcome difficulties."

Zhu Youxiao also agreed: "What the Daoist says is correct. The Tun hexagram emphasizes 'the difficulty of initial birth,' just like a seed that has just sprouted, needing careful care to thrive. Ninth Uncle is currently in this stage, needing to accumulate strength rather than acting rashly."

Zhu Youxiao furrowed his brows, looking worried: "But the imperial city is no longer safe. The Black Bone Sect can disguise themselves as Jinyiwei, which means they have already infiltrated. Keeping Ninth Uncle in the palace only makes me worry day and night."

Daoist Xuan Chen remained silent for a moment, then suddenly said: "Your Majesty,贫道 has a suggestion. There is a secret organization called 'Songlan Society' that exists to maintain the balance of the Three Realms. They have formed alliances with the Snow Spirit Cat clan, the Kabbalah Scholars Group, and other forces, and have been secretly opposing the Black Bone Sect. If Ninth Uncle can go there, he might receive protection and assistance."

"Songlan Society?" Zhu Youxiao murmured. "I've heard this name before. It's said they act secretly, with members of various identities—cultivators, demon cultivators, and even extraordinary people among ordinary mortals."

"Exactly." Daoist Xuan Chen nodded. "Members of the Songlan Society use stage names to address each other, integrating cultivation with secular art. Their bases are spread across the country, making it difficult for the Black Bone Sect to infiltrate quickly."

Zhu Changlan, still unconscious, heard most of the conversation and his heart suddenly became clear. He remembered his experiences during this period—from awakening as a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat, to obtaining the Xuan Yu Miao Dao, and then confronting the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord. He indeed had been too sharp, not considering potential dangers. Now, the Black Bone Sect's ambush served as a warning to him. And the "Songlan Society" he vaguely heard about seemed to become a new direction in his heart.

He realized that the imperial city was no longer safe. The Black Bone Sect had already infiltrated the imperial palace and could launch another attack at any time. As a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat with nine lives and powerful demon power, he was naturally the Black Bone Sect's primary target.

With this thought, Zhu Changlan no longer suppressed his consciousness and began to gradually regain control of his body. He could feel his fingers trembling slightly and his eyelids fluttering, as if he was about to wake up at any moment.

"The Prince's fingers moved!" Xiaoluzi suddenly exclaimed.

Zhu Youxiao, Daoist Xuan Chen, and Lao Tietou quickly gathered around the soft couch. They saw that Zhu Changlan's fingers were indeed trembling slightly, and his eyelids were fluttering, as if he was about to wake up.

"Ninth Uncle! You're waking up!" Zhu Youxiao held Zhu Changlan's hand, his voice filled with excitement. "How do you feel? Is there any discomfort?"

Zhu Changlan coughed a few times, speaking weakly: "Your Majesty, I'm fine, just a bit weak. By the way, when I was unconscious, I vaguely heard you mention the 'Songlan Society.' What is that place?"

Zhu Youxiao and Daoist Xuan Chen exchanged glances, never expecting that Zhu Changlan would hear their conversation. Daoist Xuan Chen spoke first: "Your Highness, the Songlan Society is a secret organization that exists to maintain the balance of the Three Realms. They have formed alliances with the Snow Spirit Cat clan, the Kabbalah Scholars Group, the descendants of Egyptian priests, and other forces, and have been secretly opposing the Black Bone Sect."

Zhu Youxiao added: "Yes. The members of the Songlan Society have various identities—cultivators, demon cultivators, and even extraordinary people among ordinary mortals. They act secretly, with bases spread across the country, and address each other by stage names, integrating cultivation with secular art. I've heard that they recently recruited a fox demon named Lin Qiwu from the Snow Spirit Valley, who is skilled in opera singing. When she transforms back into her fox form, she can change her fur color to blend with the environment, so she often serves as a messenger. I've met her once."

Daoist Xuan Chen continued: "The Songlan Society is at odds with the Black Bone Sect. They have been collecting intelligence on the Black Bone Sect and sabotaging their schemes. If Your Highness can go there, you will not only receive protection but also be able to join forces with them against the Black Bone Sect."

After listening, Zhu Changlan nodded thoughtfully: "It sounds like the Songlan Society is a good place."

Lao Tietou also stepped forward, placing the herbs on the table: "Your Highness, these herbs were specially brought by me, which can help you recover your vitality. After Your Highness wakes up, decoct one dose every day, and within half a month, you'll be completely recovered."

Zhu Changlan nodded slightly, closing his eyes and pretending to rest. But his consciousness was exceptionally clear. The name Songlan Society was deeply engraved in his mind, and he knew he had found a new direction.

Late at night, Xian'an Palace was silent.

Zhu Changlan quietly opened his eyes, feeling that the palace attendants around him had already fallen asleep. He gently got up, put on a outer robe, and walked to the window. Moonlight filtered through the carved window lattice, illuminating his face. His eyes shimmered with a faint blue light in the darkness, and the scenery outside the window was as clear as day under the dim moonlight—his night vision ability had truly recovered.

He could hear the distant sound of the night watchman, smell the faint fragrance of flowers in the air, and even feel the subtle movement of the wind through the leaves. Like a cat in the night, he could perceive everything around him.

He walked to the table, picked up the herbs left by Lao Tietou, observed them carefully for a moment, then put them back. He knew that Lao Tietou's herbs were indeed good things, but what he needed now was not to recover his vitality, but to escape from the imperial city.

He walked to the soft couch, picked up the Xuan Yu Miao Dao. The blade was carved with Big Dipper decorations, emitting a soft golden light under the moonlight. He gently stroked the blade—like a gentleman of jade, still needing a iron sword for protection.

He remembered the words of Daoist Xuan Chen and Lao Tietou, and the Tun hexagram that Daoist Xuan Chen had cast for him. He knew that now was not the time for reckless action, but he also knew that staying in the imperial city would only bring more danger. He needed an opportunity, a chance to escape the imperial city safely.

Just then, he suddenly heard a subtle movement in the distance, as if someone was climbing over the wall to enter Xian'an Palace. He immediately hid behind the door, gripping the Xuan Yu Miao Dao tightly, his eyes fixed on the entrance.

Before long, a shadow climbed through the window, holding a dagger and emanating a faint evil aura. Zhu Changlan immediately recognized this as a Black Bone Sect follower—they were still not giving up, wanting to assassinate him again.

The shadow cautiously approached the soft couch, thinking Zhu Changlan was still asleep, and raised the dagger to stab. Just then, Zhu Changlan suddenly rushed out from behind the door, the Xuan Yu Miao Dao shining with golden light under the moonlight, accurately stabbing towards the shadow's heart.

The shadow didn't expect Zhu Changlan to not be on the couch, caught off guard and stabbed by the Xuan Yu Miao Dao. It let out a scream and fell to the ground. Zhu Changlan quickly stepped forward, covering its mouth to prevent it from making more noise.

The shadow struggled a few times, then stopped moving. Zhu Changlan checked its body and found the Black Bone Sect's mark, confirming its identity.

He dragged the shadow's body to a corner, covered it with a cloth, then returned to the soft couch, continuing to pretend to sleep. He knew that this matter couldn't be made public, otherwise, it would alert the enemy and affect his escape plan.

The next morning, Zhu Youxiao came to visit Zhu Changlan, finding that his complexion had improved a lot. He was overjoyed: "Ninth Uncle, you look much better!"

Zhu Changlan smiled and nodded: "Thanks to Your Majesty's blessing, I feel much better. It's just that I had a nightmare last night, dreaming that the Black Bone Sect came to assassinate me again."

Zhu Youxiao's face darkened: "Rest assured, Ninth Uncle. I've strengthened the guards of Xian'an Palace, and I won't let the Black Bone Sect succeed again."

Zhu Changlan smiled inwardly, knowing that the Black Bone Sect had already come and been killed by him. But he didn't say this, only speaking lightly: "Your Majesty, I've thought it through. After my injury heals, I want to leave the imperial city and seek help from the Songlan Society. The Black Bone Sect's power is too great; staying in the imperial city will only bring danger to you."

Zhu Youxiao was stunned for a moment, then understood Zhu Changlan's meaning: "Ninth Uncle, you're right. The Black Bone Sect has already infiltrated the imperial palace, so staying in the imperial city is indeed unsafe. The Songlan Society is a secret organization that maintains the balance of the Three Realms with powerful strength. If you can join them, you can better resist the Black Bone Sect."

He took out a Nine-Dragon Jade Pendant from his sleeve and handed it to Zhu Changlan: "This is a royal token. With it, the people of the Songlan Society will believe in your identity. I'll arrange an escape route for you to ensure you can leave safely."

Zhu Changlan took the Nine-Dragon Jade Pendant. The pendant was carved with nine dragon patterns, and at this moment, it resonated with his natal spirit bead and Xuan Yu Miao Dao, emitting a soft glow: "Thank you, Your Majesty. After I find the Songlan Society, I will definitely find a way to contact you and join forces against the Black Bone Sect."

Zhu Youxiao nodded: "Ninth Uncle, you must take care. I believe we will meet again."

Just then, Daoist Xuan Chen walked in, holding an ancient book: "Your Highness, Your Majesty,贫道 just received news that the residual soul of the Black Bone Sect's leader has fled to Southern Xinjiang. They are gathering forces there, preparing to launch another attack. This is the perfect time for Your Highness to go to the Songlan Society."

Zhu Changlan was overjoyed—this was exactly the opportunity he had been waiting for: "What the Daoist says is correct. I'll prepare to leave now for the Songlan Society."

Daoist Xuan Chen took out a map from his sleeve and handed it to Zhu Changlan: "This is a route map to the Songlan Society, marked with the Black Bone Sect's strongholds and the locations of spirit veins. With this, you'll be much safer on the way."

Zhu Changlan took the map, carefully examining it: "Thank you, Daoist."

Lao Tietou also walked in, holding a short blade: "Your Highness, this is a short blade I specially forged for you, convenient to carry. The blade is coated with a potion that restrains evil, which can deal with Black Bone Sect followers."

Zhu Changlan took the short blade. The blade was small and sharp, carved with Big Dipper patterns, complementing the Xuan Yu Miao Dao perfectly: "Thank you, Lao Tietou."

Everything was ready. Zhu Changlan knew it was time to leave. He put on ordinary cloth clothing, wrapped the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in cloth and carried it on his back, hid Lao Tietou's short blade and the dagger given by Emperor Zhu Youxiao on his body, and took the Nine-Dragon Jade Pendant and map. Then he quietly left Xian'an Palace.

Under the moonlight, his figure gradually disappeared into the night, walking along the city wall towards the outside of the city. Just after leaving the imperial district and entering a dense grassland, he suddenly heard a细碎的 movement ahead.

Zhu Changlan stopped, warily gripping the short blade at his waist. Moonlight filtered through the gaps in the leaves, illuminating a figure in the grass—it was a fox, its fur displaying a strange blue-white gradient under the moonlight, its eyes sparkling like gems, staring directly at him.

Zhu Changlan's heart moved. This fox's fur color was very special—could it also be a demon cultivator? He was about to step forward to check when the fox suddenly stood up, and a faint glow began to emanate from its body.

"Is this... transforming?" Zhu Changlan watched the scene in surprise as the fox's body gradually lengthened. After the glow dissipated, it transformed into a woman in a blue-white skirt. Her hair cascaded down her shoulders like a waterfall, her skin was as white as snow, and the corners of her eyes were slightly upturned. She looked at him with a smile.

"You..." Zhu Changlan opened his mouth, too surprised to speak.

The woman's lips curved upward, a mischievous glint in her eyes. She seemed to want to say something, but hesitated.
