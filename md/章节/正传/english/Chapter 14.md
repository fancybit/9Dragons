# Chapter 14: Xuan Yuan Awakens, A Thousand-Year Bond

The tremors in the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground grew stronger, the cracks in the ground spreading like spider webs. Black demonic energy gushed from the fissures, clashing with the golden light of the spring, emitting a滋滋 sound. Zhu Changlan arrived at the entrance with his Jinyiwei dark forces, only to be halted by a powerful oppressive force.

"This aura... it's the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord!" Zhu Changlan's brows furrowed tightly. His Xuan Yu Miao Dao trembled slightly, seemingly sensing the ancient, terrifying pressure. He channeled his demon power and the power of the spirit bead to resist the oppression, gazing deep into the forbidden ground.

A blurry shadow loomed above the spring, its blood-red eyes flickering in the gray mist, exuding a destructive evil aura. The white-clothed demon knelt on the ground, trembling violently, while Daoist Xuan Chen and the soldiers were pinned down by the pressure, blood seeping from their lips.

Zhu Changlan's heart tightened, and he was about to rush forward when his natal spirit bead suddenly trembled violently. A torrent of unfamiliar yet familiar memories flooded his mind. He clutched his forehead in pain, blurry images appearing before his eyes: the smoke of ancient battlefields, three brothers fighting side by side, the moment Xuan Yuan transformed into a demon lord...

"These are... my past life memories?" Zhu Changlan was astonished to discover that in those memories, he and the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord were deeply connected, as if they had once been inseparable brothers, jointly protecting the balance of the Three Realms.

At that moment, the shadow suddenly turned its blood-red eyes toward Zhu Changlan. Their gazes met, and Zhu Changlan felt a powerful suction pulling his consciousness into a strange space.

"Where is this..." Zhu Changlan looked around, finding himself in chaos, with countless memory fragments floating around, each emitting a faint glow.

"You've finally come, eldest brother."

A deep, familiar voice sounded. Zhu Changlan turned to see a man in a dark robe with waist-length hair, handsome yet with a hint of devilish charm—this was the true form of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord.

"Eldest brother?" Zhu Changlan was stunned. He recalled the memory fragments: in ancient times, he, Xuan Yuan, and Xuan Chen were three brothers who jointly protected the balance of the Three Realms. And he was the eldest brother, Xuan Yu.

"Yes, eldest brother, I am Xuan Yuan." The Xuan Yuan Demon Lord walked slowly, the red in his eyes fading, replaced by a complex emotion. "It's been a long time since we've met like this."

Zhu Changlan took a deep breath, trying to calm his shock. "Xuan Yuan, why did you become a demon lord? In those memory fragments, you were once a righteous guardian. Why did you become like this?"

The Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's eyes dimmed. He reached out to touch the surrounding memory fragments, which automatically assembled into complete scenes:

In ancient times, the Three Realms were still in their infancy, with spirit veins crisscrossing, nourishing all living things. The three brothers Xuan Yu, Xuan Yuan, and Xuan Chen were ordered by the Heavenly Dao to jointly guard the source of the spirit veins, maintaining balance in the Three Realms.

Xuan Yuan was resolute and powerful, skilled in controlling water power, known as the "Water Emperor." He cared deeply for all living beings, often descending to the mortal realm to help people with various difficulties, winning widespread love.

However, a sudden disaster shattered the peace. The predecessor of the Black Bone Sect, the "Soul Devouring Sect," suddenly rose to power. They practiced evil arts, devouring souls and essence blood of living beings, attempting to open the passage to the Underworld, release Underworld煞气, and dominate the Three Realms.

The three brothers led the righteous forces in a fierce battle against the Soul Devouring Sect. The war lasted for a hundred years, countless lives were lost, and the spirit veins were severely damaged.

In the final battle, the Soul Devouring Sect leader self-destructed, releasing massive amounts of Underworld煞气. To protect the source of the spirit veins, Xuan Yuan exhausted his entire cultivation, sealing the Underworld煞气 within himself. However, the corrosive nature of the Underworld煞气 was too strong, gradually eroding Xuan Yuan's mind, eventually transforming him into a demon lord.

"I originally intended to seal the Underworld煞气 completely at the cost of my life, but I never expected the煞气 to assimilate me, turning me into the very thing I once hated the most." The Xuan Yuan Demon Lord smiled bitterly. "Eldest brother, I'm sorry for you, for Xuan Chen, and for all living beings in the Three Realms."

Looking at the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's pained expression, Zhu Changlan felt a complex emotion stirring in his heart. He remembered the righteous second brother from his memories, and then looked at the demon lord corrupted by evil energy, sighing at the impermanence of fate.

"Xuan Yuan, we're brothers. I won't give up on you." Zhu Changlan said firmly. "I will find a way to purify the Underworld煞气, restore your sanity, and bring you back to the righteous path."

A trace of emotion flickered in the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's eyes, but then dimmed again. "Eldest brother, you're too naive. The Underworld煞气 has merged with my soul. Unless I dissipate, it can never be completely purified. Moreover, my power is now out of control; I might fall again at any moment, hurting more people."

He paused, his gaze growing deep. "However, I recently felt a familiar power—the power of the Kalaba Tree of Life. Eldest brother, you have an indissoluble bond with the Tree of Life. Perhaps it can help us resolve this crisis."

"The Kalaba Tree of Life?" Zhu Changlan furrowed his brow. He had never heard of this name.

"Yes, it's a sacred tree from ancient times, containing powerful life force that can purify all evil." The Xuan Yuan Demon Lord explained. "When we three brothers guarded the source of the spirit veins, the Tree of Life grew in the core of the spirit veins, providing endless life energy to the Three Realms. Later, the evil arts of the Soul Devouring Sect damaged the foundation of the Tree of Life, causing it to fall into a deep sleep, leaving only fragments scattered across the Three Realms."

He looked at Zhu Changlan, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. "Eldest brother, you are the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, with sacred blood flowing in your veins. You have a natural affinity with the Tree of Life. If you can find the fragments of the Tree of Life and awaken it again, you might be able to purify the Underworld煞气 within me and restore my sanity."

At that moment, Zhu Changlan's consciousness was suddenly pulled by a powerful force. His body began to become transparent, clearly being forcibly sent back to the real world.

"Eldest brother, remember my words—go find the fragments of the Kalaba Tree of Life!" The Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's voice echoed in his ears. "The thousand-year bond between our three brothers will eventually be resolved beneath the Tree of Life!"

Zhu Changlan猛地 opened his eyes, finding himself back in the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground. At this time, the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord had disappeared, and the spring had returned to calm. Only the white-clothed demon still knelt on the ground, trembling.

"Daoist Xuan Chen, are you alright?" Zhu Changlan quickly walked to Daoist Xuan Chen's side, concerned.

Daoist Xuan Chen shook his head, his face pale. "I'm fine, just that the pressure earlier was too strong to bear for a while. Your Highness, what happened to you just now? Why did you suddenly fall into a coma?"

Zhu Changlan told Daoist Xuan Chen about his conversation with the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord in the consciousness space. Daoist Xuan Chen's face showed a shocked expression. "I never thought that the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord has such a deep connection with Your Highness! Moreover, he mentioned the Kalaba Tree of Life—this is a legend from ancient times!"

"Daoist, do you know about the Kalaba Tree of Life?" Zhu Changlan's eyes lit up, quickly asking.

Daoist Xuan Chen nodded, a hint of reverence in his eyes. He slowly said, "In my early years, I had the honor to read an ancient text written in ancient characters, the 'Secret Record of the Tree of Life,' in the deepest part of the Qingyun Temple's secret pavilion. It contains detailed records of the legend of the Kalaba Tree of Life. It was the most sacred existence in the Three Realms during ancient times, growing in the deepest core of the spirit veins, with roots coiling around the entire spirit vein network, and branches extending to the nine heavens. Each leaf sparkled with golden light, like countless small stars dotted in the night sky.

"The trunk of the Tree of Life was a deep purple color, covered with mysterious patterns that corresponded one by one to the ten sephiroth of the Kabbalah Tree of Life. Each leaf represented a cosmic force, and each branch connected to a different dimension. It was a true bridge connecting heaven and earth, communicating with divine beings. In those days, all living beings in the Three Realms relied on the energy of the Tree of Life to survive; its existence maintained the balance of the entire universe.

"The Tree of Life not only contained powerful life force but also had the ability to purify all evil. Whether it was Underworld煞气, Black Bone demon power, or any other evil, they would be completely purified under the Tree of Life's light, turning into the purest energy. Legend has it that when the ancient gods encountered insurmountable evil forces, they would come to the Tree of Life to purify the evil with its power.

"However, the disaster ten thousand years ago shattered all this. The leader of the Soul Devouring Sect obtained an evil forbidden technique from somewhere. He led his followers to attack the core of the spirit veins, using the forbidden technique to destroy the foundation of the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life emitted its final light in agony, purifying almost all the Soul Devouring Sect followers, but it itself fell into a deep sleep, leaving only some fragments scattered across the Three Realms.

"These fragments contain part of the Tree of Life's power. They will choose their fated ones, and only those with a deep connection to the Tree of Life can sense their existence. As the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, Your Highness has sacred blood flowing in your veins and a natural affinity with the Tree of Life. You are exactly the one in the legend who can awaken the Tree of Life."

Daoist Xuan Chen sighed, a hint of regret in his eyes. "After the Tree of Life fell into a deep sleep, the balance of the Three Realms began to gradually break down, and evil forces took the opportunity to rise. This is one of the reasons why evil forces like the Black Bone Sect could develop and grow. If Your Highness can awaken the Tree of Life again, not only can you purify the Underworld煞气 within the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord, but you can also restore the balance of the Three Realms, making evil forces have nowhere to hide."

Zhu Changlan's heart stirred. He remembered the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord's words, realizing he had such a deep connection with the Tree of Life. He decided that he must find the fragments of the Tree of Life, awaken it again, purify the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan, and resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers.

"Daoist, can you tell me more about the Kalaba Tree of Life? For example, where might its fragments be located? How can I awaken it?" Zhu Changlan asked eagerly.

Daoist Xuan Chen pondered for a moment and said, "Your Highness, the secret scripture does not have clear records about the location of the Tree of Life's fragments. However, it mentions that the fragments of the Tree of Life will choose their fated ones, and only those with a connection to it can sense their existence. As the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, you have a natural affinity with the Tree of Life and should be able to sense the location of the fragments."

He paused, then added, "As for how to awaken the Tree of Life, the secret scripture mentions that you need to collect all the fragments, then hold a sacred ceremony at the core of the spirit veins, using the blood of the holder as a guide to awaken the Tree of Life's consciousness. However, this process is extremely dangerous; if you're not careful, you will be backlashed by the Tree of Life's power and annihilated."

Zhu Changlan nodded. He was already prepared to take risks. To resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers and protect the balance of the Three Realms, he was willing to pay any price.

"Daoist, I've decided. I will go find the fragments of the Kalaba Tree of Life and awaken it again." Zhu Changlan said firmly. "Please help me, teach me how to sense the fragments of the Tree of Life and how to interpret its power."

Looking at Zhu Changlan's determined eyes, Daoist Xuan Chen felt a surge of admiration. He nodded and said, "Since Your Highness has made up your mind, I will do my utmost to assist you. However, before searching for the Tree of Life fragments, Your Highness needs to first learn how to interpret the structure and power of the Kabbalah Tree of Life."

He took out an ancient book from his bosom, with the words "Interpretation of the Kabbalah Tree of Life" written in ancient characters on the cover. "This is one of the secret scriptures of Qingyun Temple, recording the structure of the Kabbalah Tree of Life and methods for interpreting its power. Your Highness can start learning from this book, understanding the basic structure of the Tree of Life and the meaning of each sephirah."

Zhu Changlan took the book, filled with gratitude. "Thank you, Daoist! I will study diligently and master the interpretation methods of the Tree of Life as soon as possible."

In the following days, Zhu Changlan stayed in the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground, under the guidance of Daoist Xuan Chen, beginning systematic learning of the interpretation of the Kabbalah Tree of Life. Daoist Xuan Chen prepared a quiet meditation room for him, with a huge Tree of Life diagram displayed inside, detailing the locations and names of the ten sephiroth and twenty-two paths.

"Your Highness, the Kabbalah Tree of Life is not an ordinary tree structure, but a model of cosmic energy flow, a manifestation of divine power in the Three Realms." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the diagram, slowly explaining. "Its ten sephiroth represent different divine powers and spiritual realms, while the twenty-two paths represent the transformation process from one realm to another. Each path corresponds to a Major Arcana tarot card, containing profound wisdom and power.

"Let's start from the top of the Tree of Life, learning the first sephirah: **Crown (Kether)**." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to a golden dot at the top of the diagram. "The Crown is the apex of the Tree of Life, representing the divine source, the origin of all existence. It connects to infinite divine power, symbolizing pure consciousness and perfect unity. In this realm, there is no duality, no time and space, only pure existence. For cultivators, reaching the Crown realm means unity with the divine source, gaining infinite wisdom and power.

"Next is **Wisdom (Chokmah)**, located to the lower right of the Crown." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the second sephirah. "Wisdom represents masculine creativity and wisdom, the first manifestation of divine power. It symbolizes the creative force of the universe, the origin of all things. In cultivation, Wisdom corresponds to intuition and inspiration, a bridge connecting the divine source with the material world.

"Opposite to it is **Understanding (Binah)**, located to the lower left of the Crown." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the third sephirah. "Understanding represents feminine inclusiveness and comprehension, the second manifestation of divine power. It symbolizes the nurturing force of the universe, the formation and development of all things. In cultivation, Understanding corresponds to reason and analysis, the ability to transform inspiration into specific forms.

"The combination of Wisdom and Understanding produces the fourth sephirah: **Mercy (Chesed)**, located below Wisdom." Daoist Xuan Chen continued explaining. "Mercy represents love and compassion, the third manifestation of divine power. It symbolizes universal love and inclusiveness, the nourishment and protection of all life. In cultivation, Mercy corresponds to selfless love and dedication, the ability to transmit divine power to others.

"Opposite to it is **Severity (Geburah)**, located below Understanding." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the fifth sephirah. "Severity represents judgment and strictness, the fourth manifestation of divine power. It symbolizes universal laws and order, the punishment of evil and chaos. In cultivation, Severity corresponds to courage and determination, the power to maintain justice and order.

"The balance between Mercy and Severity produces the sixth sephirah: **Beauty (Tiphareth)**, located at the center of the Tree of Life." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the core position of the diagram. "Beauty represents balance and beauty, the core of the Tree of Life, connecting all sephiroth above and below. It symbolizes universal balance and harmony, the perfect state of all things. In cultivation, Beauty corresponds to inner peace and harmony, the ability to balance and use various powers.

"Next is **Victory (Netzach)**, located below Mercy." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the seventh sephirah. "Victory represents victory and perseverance, the fifth manifestation of divine power. It symbolizes cosmic vitality and tenacity, the power to overcome all difficulties. In cultivation, Victory corresponds to perseverance and persistence, the courage to keep moving forward in adversity.

"Opposite to it is **Glory (Hod)**, located below Severity." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the eighth sephirah. "Glory represents glory and dignity, the sixth manifestation of divine power. It symbolizes universal order and regularity, the perfect manifestation of all things. In cultivation, Glory corresponds to wisdom and knowledge, a profound understanding of cosmic laws.

"The combination of Victory and Glory produces the ninth sephirah: **Foundation (Yesod)**, located below Beauty." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the ninth sephirah. "Foundation represents foundation and root, the bridge connecting the material and spiritual worlds. It symbolizes universal subconsciousness and dreams, the medium for transforming spiritual power into material reality. In cultivation, Foundation corresponds to subconsciousness and intuition, the ability to connect with the inner world.

"Finally, there is **Kingdom (Malkuth)**, located at the bottom of the Tree of Life." Daoist Xuan Chen pointed to the last sephirah. "Kingdom represents kingdom and the material world, the foundation of the Tree of Life, nourishing all living things in the world. It symbolizes the material world we live in, the final manifestation of all divine power. In cultivation, Kingdom corresponds to achievements and practice in the material world, the ability to apply divine wisdom to daily life.

"Now, let's learn the twenty-two Major Arcana paths." Daoist Xuan Chen took out an ancient tarot deck and spread it on the table. This deck's cards had an ancient golden luster, with some wear on the edges, clearly having withstood the test of time. Daoist Xuan Chen gently stroked the cards, a trace of memory in his eyes. "This deck was obtained when I was young at the peak of Kunlun Mountain. It has accompanied me through countless days and nights, witnessing my cultivation journey. Each path corresponds to a Major Arcana tarot card, representing the transformation process from one sephirah to another, containing profound wisdom and power, which is also closely related to Your Highness's destiny.

"Let's start with the last path, which is from Crown to Kingdom, corresponding to the **Fool** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the twenty-second card, which depicted a young man with a backpack and a white rose, standing on a cliff, ready to start a new journey. "The Fool represents beginnings and adventures, new journeys and infinite possibilities. On this path, cultivators learn to let go of past experiences and fears, bravely starting new journeys.

"Your Highness, do you know that I was also a 'Fool' when I was young?" A hint of nostalgia flashed in Daoist Xuan Chen's eyes. "At that time, I had just entered Qingyun Temple, knowing nothing about Daoism, but filled with enthusiasm to explore the mysteries of the universe. I carried a simple backpack and went to Kunlun Mountain alone to cultivate. Along the way, I encountered countless difficulties and dangers, but I never retreated, always maintaining a childlike heart. It was this 'Fool's' courage that allowed me to finally obtain this tarot deck and begin my cultivation journey.

"And Your Highness, you are now in the transition phase from Fool to Magician." Daoist Xuan Chen looked at Zhu Changlan meaningfully. "You were originally a carefree Ninth Prince, but suddenly awakened your past life memories, learning that you are the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, shouldering the mission of resolving the thousand-year bond between the three brothers. This is a completely new beginning for you, just like the Fool standing on the cliff, about to embark on an unknown journey. But you have already demonstrated the courage of a 'Fool,' bravely accepting this mission, ready to find the fragments of the Tree of Life and reawaken it.

"Next is the first path, from Crown to Wisdom, corresponding to the **Magician** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the first card, which depicted a magician holding a wand, with four element symbols on the table. "The Magician represents creativity and action, the ability to transform divine power into concrete forms. On this path, cultivators learn to use their creativity to turn inspiration into reality.

"Your Highness, look at the wand in the Magician's hand—it's like your Xuan Yu Miao Dao, able to transform the demon power and spirit bead power within you into powerful attack force. The four element symbols on the table represent the basic elements that make up the universe, and also symbolize the various powers you need to master. When you grow from a 'Fool' to a 'Magician,' you will be able to skillfully use these powers, transforming divine inspiration into concrete action, striving to protect the balance of the Three Realms.

"The second path is from Crown to Understanding, corresponding to the **High Priestess** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the second card, which depicted a High Priestess sitting on a throne, holding a scroll. "The High Priestess represents intuition and wisdom, a bridge connecting the divine source with the subconscious. On this path, cultivators learn to listen to their inner voice and obtain divine wisdom.

"In my youth, I met a mysterious High Priestess in a cave on Kunlun Mountain. She taught me how to listen to my inner voice and how to connect with the divine source. It was her guidance that allowed me to understand the wisdom of tarot cards and master the interpretation methods of the Tree of Life. Your Highness also has this talent—you can communicate directly with the Tree of Life, which is the manifestation of the High Priestess's wisdom in you.

"The third path is from Crown to Beauty, corresponding to the **Empress** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the third card, which depicted an Empress sitting in a flower field, holding a scepter. "The Empress represents abundance and creation, the nurturer and protector of life. On this path, cultivators learn to accept and nourish their inner life.

"Your Highness, the flower field around the Empress is like your relatives and people—they need your nourishment and protection. As the Ninth Prince, you shoulder the responsibility of protecting the people; as the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, you also shoulder the mission of protecting life in the Three Realms. When you reach the Empress's realm, you will be able to nourish all things with your love and compassion, creating a rich and harmonious world.

"The fourth path is from Wisdom to Mercy, corresponding to the **Emperor** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the fourth card, which depicted an Emperor sitting on a throne, holding a scepter. "The Emperor represents authority and order, the executor of cosmic laws. On this path, cultivators learn to use their power to maintain justice and order.

"As a member of the royal family, Your Highness naturally understands the responsibilities and mission of an Emperor. But the 'Emperor' here is not a secular ruler, but a maintainer of cosmic laws. When you reach the Emperor's realm, you will be able to use your power to maintain order in the Three Realms, punish evil, and protect justice. Just like your elimination of the remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect this time—you were fulfilling the Emperor's duty, maintaining justice and order in the world.

"The fifth path is from Understanding to Severity, corresponding to the **Hierophant** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the fifth card, which depicted a Hierophant holding a scepter, sitting on a throne, with two believers below. "The Hierophant represents tradition and faith, the disseminator of divine wisdom. On this path, cultivators learn to inherit and spread divine wisdom.

"As a Daoist of Qingyun Temple, I have always been inheriting and spreading the wisdom of Daoism—that is the mission of the Hierophant. And Your Highness, in the future, will also become a disseminator of divine wisdom, passing on the wisdom of the Tree of Life and the mysteries of tarot cards to future generations, letting more people understand the truth of the universe and jointly protect the balance of the Three Realms.

"The sixth path is from Mercy to Victory, corresponding to the **Lovers** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the sixth card, which depicted a pair of lovers with an angel above. "The Lovers represent love and choice, the union and growth of souls. On this path, cultivators learn to love themselves and others, making correct choices.

"The relationship between Your Highness and your brothers Xuan Yuan and Xuan Chen is the best embodiment of the Lovers card. The three of you were originally soul-connected as one, but due to various reasons, estrangement and conflict arose. However, the love between you has never disappeared—it is this love that makes you want to resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers and restore Xuan Yuan's sanity. When you learn true love and make the correct choice, you will win this soul war, reuniting the three brothers.

"The seventh path is from Severity to Glory, corresponding to the **Chariot** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the seventh card, which depicted a warrior driving a chariot with griffins and warhorses. "The Chariot represents courage and will, the power to overcome difficulties. On this path, cultivators learn to use their will to overcome obstacles on the path forward.

"Your Highness's confrontation with the residual soul of the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord in the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground, and your battle with the remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect in Qingxi Town, have all demonstrated the courage and will of the Chariot. You drive your own 'chariot,' overcoming one difficulty after another, advancing toward your goal. In future journeys, you will encounter more challenges, but as long as you maintain this courage and will, you will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and reach the shore of victory.

"The eighth path is from Victory to Foundation, corresponding to the **Strength** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the eighth card, which depicted a young woman taming a lion. "Strength represents courage and gentleness, inner strength and confidence. On this path, cultivators learn to use the power of love and gentleness to overcome inner fears and challenges.

"Although Your Highness possesses powerful demon power and spirit bead power, you do not rely on violence to solve problems. You comfort disaster-stricken people with poetry, treat wrongdoers with compassion, demonstrating true 'strength.' This strength does not come from external violence, but from inner love and gentleness—it is the power that can truly conquer everything.

"The ninth path is from Glory to Foundation, corresponding to the **Hermit** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the ninth card, which depicted a hermit holding a lantern, standing on a mountaintop. "The Hermit represents wisdom and solitude, the process of inner exploration and search for truth. On this path, cultivators learn to be alone and reflect, searching for inner truth.

"When I was young, I cultivated alone for ten years at the peak of Kunlun Mountain. That period was the most important time in my life. In solitude, I reflected on my inner self, explored the truths of the universe, and finally gained true wisdom. Your Highness also needs such solitude time—away from the hustle and bustle of the outside world, delving into your own heart, searching for the truth and mission of life.

"The tenth path is from Foundation to Kingdom, corresponding to the **Wheel of Fortune** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the tenth card, which depicted a turning wheel with various symbolic symbols around it. "The Wheel of Fortune represents change and destiny, the cycle and balance of the universe. On this path, cultivators learn to accept the changes of fate and follow the laws of the universe.

"Your Highness should have already felt the impermanence of fate. You were originally a carefree Ninth Prince, but suddenly awakened your past life memories, shouldering a heavy mission. But this is not a coincidence—it is the arrangement of fate, the need for cosmic balance. When you learn to accept the changes of fate and follow the laws of the universe, you will be able to better fulfill your mission and protect the balance of the Three Realms.

"The eleventh path is from Beauty to Foundation, corresponding to the **Justice** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the eleventh card, which depicted a goddess of justice holding a balance and a sword. "Justice represents fairness and balance, the laws and order of the universe. On this path, cultivators learn to maintain inner balance and fairness, abiding by cosmic laws.

"As the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, Your Highness shoulders the mission of protecting the balance of the Three Realms. This requires you to maintain inner fairness and justice, treating every life impartially, and abiding by cosmic laws. Only in this way can you truly maintain the balance of the Three Realms and fulfill your mission.

"The twelfth path is from Victory to Kingdom, corresponding to the **Hanged Man** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the twelfth card, which depicted a man hanging upside down from a tree. "The Hanged Man represents sacrifice and letting go, the wisdom of looking at things from different perspectives. On this path, cultivators learn to let go of the self, looking at problems from a higher perspective.

"Your Highness is willing to pay any price to resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers—that is the embodiment of the Hanged Man spirit. You have let go of your identity as the Ninth Prince, let go of secular power and status, looking at your mission from a higher perspective. This sacrifice and letting go have given you deeper wisdom, bringing you closer to your goal.

"The thirteenth path is from Glory to Kingdom, corresponding to the **Death** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the thirteenth card, which depicted a grim reaper holding a scythe, harvesting lives. "Death represents endings and new beginnings, the end of old things and the beginning of new things. On this path, cultivators learn to accept endings and welcome new beginnings.

"Your Highness's awakening of past life memories means that your old identity as 'Ninth Prince Zhu Changlan' has ended, and your new identity as 'Reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor' has begun. This is like the grim reaper's scythe, harvesting the old life but also nurturing a new one. When you learn to accept this 'death' and 'rebirth,' you will be able to better adapt to your new identity and fulfill your mission.

"The fourteenth path is from Mercy to Beauty, corresponding to the **Temperance** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the fourteenth card, which depicted an angel blending two cups of water. "Temperance represents balance and harmony, the fusion and balance of different forces. On this path, cultivators learn to balance various inner forces, achieving a state of harmony.

"Your Highness simultaneously possesses demon power, spirit bead power, and the power of Tree of Life fragments. These powers come from different sources and have different natures. You need to learn to blend these powers, allowing them to coexist harmoniously within you, forming a complete energy cycle. When you reach the 'Temperance' realm, you will be able to perfectly blend these powers, exerting their maximum power.

"The fifteenth path is from Severity to Beauty, corresponding to the **Devil** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the fifteenth card, which depicted a devil holding a torch, with chains around him. "The Devil represents desire and bondage, inner fears and attachments. On this path, cultivators learn to face their inner fears and desires, freeing themselves from their bondage.

"In your journey to find the fragments of the Tree of Life, Your Highness may encounter various temptations and challenges, such as the temptation of power, the desire for revenge, the fear of failure, etc. These are all incarnations of the 'Devil,' wanting to bind your mind and hinder your progress. But as long as you can face these inner 'devils' and see their true nature, you will be able to break free from their bondage and gain true freedom.

"The sixteenth path is from Crown to Foundation, corresponding to the **Tower** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the sixteenth card, which depicted a tower collapsing, with people falling from the top. "The Tower represents subversion and awakening, the collapse of old structures and concepts, and new awakening. On this path, cultivators learn to let go of old concepts and bondage, welcoming new awakening.

"Your Highness's process of awakening past life memories is exactly the process of the 'Tower' collapsing and awakening. Your old worldview and self-perception were completely subverted, replaced by a brand-new awakening. Although this awakening is painful, it is a necessary path for your growth, allowing you to see your true mission clearly and embark on the correct cultivation path.

"The seventeenth path is from Wisdom to Beauty, corresponding to the **Star** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the seventeenth card, which depicted a young woman pouring water into a pond, with stars shining above. "The Star represents hope and inspiration, inner hope and divine guidance. On this path, cultivators learn to maintain inner hope and accept divine guidance.

"In your journey to find the fragments of the Tree of Life, Your Highness may encounter various difficulties and setbacks, feeling confused and helpless. But as long as you maintain inner hope, like the stars in the night sky, always illuminating your path forward. At the same time, you must also learn to accept divine guidance, just like your direct communication with the Tree of Life, which will point you in the right direction.

"The eighteenth path is from Understanding to Beauty, corresponding to the **Moon** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the eighteenth card, which depicted a full moon, with wolves and dogs howling below, and a lobster crawling out of the pond. "The Moon represents the subconscious and dreams, inner fears and unknowns. On this path, cultivators learn to face their inner fears and unknowns, exploring the depths of their subconscious.

"Your Highness often sees fragments of past life memories in dreams—these are messages from the subconscious, reflections of your inner fears and desires. You need to learn to interpret these dreams, exploring your own subconscious, in order to truly understand your inner self, resolve inner conflicts, and achieve inner harmony.

"The nineteenth path is from Wisdom to Glory, corresponding to the **Sun** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the nineteenth card, which depicted a child riding a horse, with sunlight shining around. "The Sun represents light and vitality, inner light and joy. On this path, cultivators learn to release their inner light and joy, illuminating themselves and others.

"Although Your Highness shoulders a heavy mission, you always maintain a sunny heart, infecting those around you with your warmth and joy. When you reach the 'Sun' realm, you will be able to release even more powerful light and joy, illuminating the entire Three Realms, dispelling all darkness and evil.

"The twentieth path is from Understanding to Victory, corresponding to the **Judgment** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the twentieth card, which depicted an angel blowing a trumpet, with the dead rising from their graves. "Judgment represents awakening and rebirth, inner awakening and soul rebirth. On this path, cultivators learn to awaken their souls, gaining the power of rebirth.

"As the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, Your Highness has already awakened your past life memories, but this is only the beginning of soul awakening. In future journeys, you will experience deeper awakening, allowing your soul to be completely reborn, restoring all the power and wisdom of the Xuan Yu Emperor. When you reach the 'Judgment' realm, you will gain the power of rebirth, truly resolving the thousand-year bond between the three brothers and protecting the balance of the Three Realms.

"The twenty-first path is from Mercy to Severity, corresponding to the **World** card." Daoist Xuan Chen drew the twenty-first card, which depicted a naked young woman, surrounded by four element symbols, encircled by a garland. "The World represents completion and perfection, the completion and perfection of life. On this path, cultivators learn to accept their life journey, achieving a state of perfection.

"When Your Highness finds all the fragments of the Tree of Life, reawakens the Tree of Life, purifies the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan, and resolves the thousand-year bond between the three brothers, you will reach the 'World' realm. At this time, you will have completed your mission, achieved the perfection of life, become the true Xuan Yu Emperor, and protect the balance and harmony of the Three Realms.

"These twenty-two Major Arcana paths together form the energy network of the Tree of Life, representing the complete transformation process from the divine source to the material world." Daoist Xuan Chen rearranged the cards. "For cultivators, learning the wisdom of these paths means understanding the operating laws of the universe, mastering the transformation process of life, thereby gaining powerful power and wisdom.

"Your Highness, you are currently in the transition phase from Fool to Magician, which is a very critical period. During this phase, you need to learn how to use your creativity and action ability to transform divine inspiration into concrete actions. At the same time, you must continue to maintain the courage of a 'Fool,' bravely facing unknown challenges, constantly exploring the mysteries of the universe.

"In future journeys, you will reach the realm of wisdom, learning the mystical structure of tarot and the Tree of Life. You will understand the operating laws of the universe, master the transformation process of life, become the true Xuan Yu Emperor, and protect the balance and harmony of the Three Realms."

"Now, Your Highness can try to integrate your consciousness into the energy network of the Tree of Life, feeling the power of each sephirah and path." Daoist Xuan Chen instructed. "Close your eyes, take a deep breath, focus your consciousness on the Crown sephirah of the Tree of Life, feel its divine power, then move down along the paths, feeling the energy of each sephirah and path."

Following Daoist Xuan Chen's guidance, Zhu Changlan closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and focused his consciousness on the Crown sephirah of the Tree of Life. Instantly, he felt a powerful divine force flowing into his body from the Crown sephirah. This force was pure and warm, like a mother's embrace, making him feel extremely peaceful and happy.

"Now, move your consciousness to the Wisdom sephirah." Daoist Xuan Chen's voice sounded in his ear.

Zhu Changlan moved his consciousness to the Wisdom sephirah as instructed. Instantly, he felt a powerful creative force flowing into his body from the Wisdom sephirah. This force was full of vitality and inspiration, making his thinking clear and agile, as if he could洞察 all the mysteries of the universe.

"Next is the Understanding sephirah." Daoist Xuan Chen continued guiding.

Zhu Changlan moved his consciousness to the Understanding sephirah. Instantly, he felt a powerful inclusive force flowing into his body from the Understanding sephirah. This force was warm and accepting, allowing him to understand and embrace all things, as if he could see the essence and truth of things.

In this way, under Daoist Xuan Chen's guidance, Zhu Changlan successively felt the power of the ten sephiroth and twenty-two paths of the Tree of Life. He discovered that each sephirah and path corresponded to an energy center within his body. When his consciousness focused on a certain sephirah or path, the corresponding energy center would be activated, releasing powerful energy.

As he studied deeper, Zhu Changlan increasingly felt the wonderful契合 between the Tree of Life and his own energy. He discovered that the flow path of the demon power and spirit bead power within his body actually corresponded one by one to the twenty-two paths of the Tree of Life. When he channeled the demon power and spirit bead power, the energy would flow along the paths of the Tree of Life, from the Crown sephirah all the way to the Kingdom sephirah, forming a complete energy cycle.

During this process, Zhu Changlan's understanding of the Tree of Life became deeper and deeper. He realized that the Tree of Life was not just a cultivation model, but the essence and truth of the universe. It represented the structure and operating laws of all existence, a bridge connecting the divine source with the material world.

"Your Highness, you have now preliminarily mastered the structure and energy flow laws of the Tree of Life." Daoist Xuan Chen said with satisfaction. "Next, we will learn how to sense the fragments of the Tree of Life and how to integrate the power of the fragments into your cultivation."

"Your Highness, you have preliminarily mastered the basic structure of the Tree of Life, and now you can try to sense the fragments of the Tree of Life." Daoist Xuan Chen said. "You can align your consciousness with the frequency of the Tree of Life through meditation, which will allow you to sense the existence of the fragments."

Following Daoist Xuan Chen's guidance, Zhu Changlan sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to meditate. He took a deep breath, completely emptied his consciousness, let the demon power and spirit bead power flow freely within his body, gradually aligning with the frequency of the Tree of Life.

As the meditation deepened, Zhu Changlan's consciousness gradually broke free from the constraints of his physical body, floating toward an unknown space. In this space, there was no concept of time and space, only endless darkness, and a faint light flickering in the distance.

"What's that?" Zhu Changlan's consciousness floated toward the direction of the light. As the distance narrowed, he gradually saw the source of the light. It was an endless forest, and each tree in the forest shone with a different color of light—some were golden, some were silver, some were blue, some were green—like countless small stars dotted in the night sky.

Zhu Changlan's consciousness drifted into the forest, immediately surrounded by a rich life force. This force was pure and warm, as if it could nourish all life, making him feel extremely comfortable and peaceful. He could feel that each tree in this forest had its own consciousness and vitality, and they were interconnected, forming a huge life network.

"This is the consciousness space of the Kalaba Tree of Life!" Zhu Changlan's heart moved. He realized that he had entered the deep consciousness of the Tree of Life, directly communicating with it.

At that moment, his consciousness was suddenly pulled by a powerful attraction, floating toward the center of the forest. The center of the forest was an open meadow, and on the meadow grew a huge tree—this tree had a deep purple trunk, with branches extending to the sky, and each leaf sparkled with golden light. It was the legendary Kalaba Tree of Life!

Zhu Changlan's consciousness stopped in front of the Tree of Life, looking up at its tall body, filled with awe and shock. He could feel that this Tree of Life contained unimaginable powerful power—every breath of it could cause the entire forest to tremble, and every quiver of its leaves could affect the energy flow of the entire universe.

"Xuan Yu, you've finally come." A gentle and ancient voice sounded in Zhu Changlan's consciousness, this voice seemed to come from the depths of the universe, full of wisdom and慈爱.

"Are you the Kalaba Tree of Life?" Zhu Changlan asked in surprise.

"Yes, I am the Kalaba Tree of Life, the source of cosmic life force." The voice of the Tree of Life echoed in his consciousness. "Xuan Yu, you are the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, with a deep connection to me. I know your purpose here—you want to find my fragments, reawaken me, and purify the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan."

"Yes, I want to help Xuan Yuan, resolve the thousand-year bond between our three brothers." Zhu Changlan said sincerely. "Please tell me, how can I find your fragments and reawaken you?"

The Tree of Life was silent for a moment, then slowly said, "My fragments are scattered across the Three Realms. Each fragment contains part of my power and consciousness. They will choose their fated ones, and only those with a deep connection to me can sense their existence.

"However, you have a natural affinity with me. I can bestow a fragment upon you, helping you start your journey to find other fragments." The voice of the Tree of Life became gentler. "This fragment contains my life force. It will merge with your demon power and spirit bead power, enhancing your power and perception, helping you find other fragments.

"But remember, the process of awakening me is full of danger and challenge. You need to face your inner fears and desires, overcome numerous difficulties, before you can finally awaken me. Are you ready?"

"I'm ready!" Zhu Changlan said firmly. "To resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers, to protect the balance of the Three Realms, I'm willing to pay any price!"

"Good." The voice of the Tree of Life was full of approval. "Now, extend your hand and accept my fragment."

Zhu Changlan extended his hand as instructed. Instantly, a branch of the Tree of Life slowly lowered, and a golden leaf fell from the branch, landing in his hand. This leaf sparkled with dazzling golden light, containing powerful life force, making his consciousness feel extremely warm and comfortable.

"This is my first fragment. It will merge with your body, becoming part of your power." The voice of the Tree of Life echoed in his consciousness. "When you find all the fragments and reassemble them, I will wake up, helping you purify the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan and resolve the thousand-year bond between your three brothers.

"Remember, Xuan Yu, your mission is not only to awaken me, but also to protect the balance of the Three Realms, allowing the power of life to fill the entire universe again. I believe in you—you will definitely be able to complete this mission!"

At that moment, Zhu Changlan's consciousness was suddenly pulled by a powerful force. His body began to become transparent, clearly being forcibly sent back to the real world.

"Tree of Life, I will definitely find all the fragments and reawaken you!" Zhu Changlan's consciousness echoed in the forest. "I will definitely complete my mission and protect the balance of the Three Realms!"

Zhu Changlan猛地 opened his eyes, finding himself back in the meditation room. At this time, a golden leaf had appeared in his hand—it was the fragment of the Kalaba Tree of Life!

This leaf sparkled with a dazzling golden light, containing powerful life force. He could clearly feel that the life force in the leaf was merging with his demon power and spirit bead power, forming a complete energy cycle. His body seemed to be injected with new vitality, every cell full of life force, and his perception had also been greatly enhanced, able to clearly feel the energy flow around him.

"I succeeded! I obtained the fragment of the Kalaba Tree of Life!" Zhu Changlan said excitedly, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

Daoist Xuan Chen looked at the golden leaf in Zhu Changlan's hand, a pleased smile on his face. "Congratulations, Your Highness! You have successfully obtained the first fragment of the Tree of Life, which shows that you have a deep connection with the Tree of Life."

He walked to Zhu Changlan's side, carefully observing the golden leaf. "This leaf contains powerful life force, and it has perfectly merged with your demon power and spirit bead power, forming a complete energy cycle. This fusion not only enhances your power, but also improves your perception, allowing you to clearly feel the energy flow around you and more easily find other fragments.

"Now, Your Highness can try to integrate the power of this fragment into your cultivation, further enhancing your strength." Daoist Xuan Chen instructed. "Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and guide the power of the fragment to all parts of your body, allowing it to completely merge with your demon power and spirit bead power."

Following Daoist Xuan Chen's guidance, Zhu Changlan closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and guided the power of the golden leaf to all parts of his body. Instantly, he felt a powerful life force flowing into his body from the leaf, merging with his demon power and spirit bead power, forming a strange three-colored light (golden, green, blue). This light flowed within his body, nourishing every cell, enhancing every energy center.

As the energy merged, changes began to occur in Zhu Changlan's body. His skin became smoother and more delicate, emitting a faint golden light; his eyes became brighter, as if they could see through everything; his aura became more stable and powerful, as if containing the power of the entire universe.

"This is amazing!" Zhu Changlan opened his eyes, looking at his hands in surprise. "I can feel that my power has become stronger, and my perception has been greatly enhanced. I can now clearly feel the energy flow around me, and even sense life force from far away."

Daoist Xuan Chen looked at Zhu Changlan's changes, a satisfied smile on his face. "Your Highness, you have successfully integrated the power of the Tree of Life fragment into your body—this is an important milestone. Now, you have the ability to find other fragments. Next, you can begin your journey to find the fragments.

"However, Your Highness, you must remember that the journey to find the fragments is full of danger and challenge. The remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect are searching for the fragments of the Tree of Life everywhere, wanting to take possession of them to help the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord break the seal. You must be careful and protect yourself and the fragments in your hand, not letting them fall into the hands of bad people.

"Additionally, you must always pay attention to your inner self, not being confused by power and desire. Although the power of the Tree of Life is strong, it can also easily make people lose themselves. You must maintain inner clarity and firmness, always remembering your mission, in order to ultimately complete the task."

Zhu Changlan nodded, his gaze firm. "Don't worry, Daoist. I will be careful and protect myself and the fragments in my hand. I will always maintain inner clarity and firmness, remembering my mission, and ultimately find all the fragments, reawaken the Tree of Life, purify the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan, and resolve the thousand-year bond between our three brothers!"

At that moment, a Jinyiwei dark force member hurried over, his face showing anxiousness. He knelt down and reported, "Your Highness, something terrible has happened! The remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect are causing chaos in the nearby Qingxi Town, killing many people, and even claiming that they want to find the fragments of the Tree of Life to help the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord break the seal!"

Zhu Changlan's face instantly became serious. He clenched the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in his hand, a flash of sharpness in his eyes. "The remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect dare to be so rampant! They jumped out to cause chaos just as I obtained the fragment of the Tree of Life—they are clearly provoking me! I will go clean them up now, and by the way, look for other fragments of the Tree of Life!"

Daoist Xuan Chen quickly said, "Your Highness, you have just mastered the power of the Tree of Life and are not yet familiar with the use of the fragment. It may be dangerous to go alone. Why don't I send a few Qingyun Temple disciples to go with you, so that you can have some support?"

Zhu Changlan shook his head and said, "No need, Daoist. I have now mastered the power of the Tree of Life, and with the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in my hand, I am sufficient to deal with those remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect. Moreover, I need to practice alone to better master the power of the Tree of Life and find more fragments.

"However, don't worry, Daoist. I will take the Jinyiwei dark forces with me—they are all loyal and skilled experts, sufficient to deal with various unexpected situations." Zhu Changlan added. "I'll leave the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground to you—you must guard it well, preventing the remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect from attacking again. If you have any news about the Xuan Yuan Demon Lord, or find clues about other fragments of the Tree of Life, you must notify me immediately."

Daoist Xuan Chen nodded and said, "Don't worry, Your Highness. I will guard the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground well, cultivate day and night, ready to support you at any time. You must be careful outside, and remember to contact me at any time. If you encounter difficulties that you cannot solve, you must return to the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground immediately, and we will discuss countermeasures together."

Zhu Changlan packed his bags, wore the Xuan Yu Miao Dao at his waist, and safely stored the fragment of the Tree of Life in his bosom. He walked to the door of the meditation room, turned to look at Daoist Xuan Chen, his eyes sparkling with determination. "Daoist, I'm leaving. After I clean up the remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect, I will embark on the journey to find the fragments of the Tree of Life. I will definitely find all the fragments, reawaken the Tree of Life, purify the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan, resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers, and restore peace and tranquility to the Three Realms!"

With that, Zhu Changlan led the Jinyiwei dark forces and left the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground, heading toward Qingxi Town.

Qingxi Town is located in the southeast of the Spirit Vein Forbidden Ground, a prosperous small town where most residents make a living by planting spiritual herbs and collecting medicine. However, when Zhu Changlan and his group arrived at Qingxi Town, the scene before them left them stunned.

The streets of the town were full of ruins, houses burned down, shops looted, and the ground still had traces of dried blood and the bodies of Black Bone Sect followers. The trees on both sides of the street hung with the bodies of innocent people—their faces still showed expressions of terror and pain, clearly killed by Black Bone Sect followers without any defense.

A flash of anger appeared in Zhu Changlan's eyes. He clenched the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in his hand, and the demon power and spirit bead power around him surged. The golden demon power intertwined with the green spiritual energy, forming a dazzling light screen. "The remaining forces of the Black Bone Sect actually dare to harm innocent people like this! I will tear you into pieces!"

At that moment, a eerie laugh came from the center of the town: "Hahahaha! Zhu Changlan, you've finally come! We've been waiting for you for a long time!"

Zhu Changlan looked up, seeing a group of Black Bone Sect followers gathered in the town square. They were surrounded by a strong evil aura, holding various evil weapons. The leader was a man in black with a scar on his face—he was a hall master of the Black Bone Sect.

"You heartless bastards, how dare you harm innocent people! Today, I Zhu Changlan will act on behalf of heaven and eliminate you all!" Zhu Changlan roared, leaping toward the square, the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in his hand shining with a dazzling light.

The hall master of the Black Bone Sect sneered, waving his hand to signal his followers to attack. Instantly, dozens of Black Bone Sect followers swarmed forward, their weapons carrying a strong evil aura, slashing at Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan was not afraid at all. The Xuan Yu Miao Dao in his hand danced impenetrably, each strike carrying powerful demon power, spirit bead power, and the purification power of the Tree of Life fragment. His figure was agile, like a hunting snow spirit cat, shuttling freely among the followers' attacks. Every strike could kill a follower, purifying a wave of evil aura.

The Jinyiwei dark forces also did not show weakness. They held their weapons and engaged in fierce battles with the Black Bone Sect followers. They cooperated with each other, dividing and surrounding the followers, breaking them one by one, and quickly killing most of the followers.

Seeing this, the hall master of the Black Bone Sect showed a look of fear. He turned to run, but was stopped by Zhu Changlan. "Want to run? It's not that easy!" Zhu Changlan swung the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in his hand, and a golden sword qi slashed toward the hall master.

The hall master quickly raised his evil weapon to block, but the power of the Xuan Yu Miao Dao far exceeded his imagination. The golden sword qi instantly split the evil weapon in half, and the remaining force slashed at the hall master. The hall master let out a shrill scream, his body split in two by the sword qi, and the evil aura around him was completely purified by the purification power of the Tree of Life fragment, turning into a wisp of black smoke.

The battle soon ended. All the Black Bone Sect followers were eliminated, and the crisis in Qingxi Town was resolved. Zhu Changlan stood in the center of the square, slowly sheathing the Xuan Yu Miao Dao in his hand, a trace of exhaustion on his face.

The Jinyiwei dark forces walked to his side, concernedly asking, "Your Highness, are you okay?"

Zhu Changlan shook his head and said, "I'm fine. It's just that seeing the bodies of these innocent people makes me feel a bit sad. If I had arrived earlier, I might have been able to save more people."

"Your Highness doesn't need to blame yourself—you've done your best." A Jinyiwei dark force member comforted. "These Black Bone Sect followers are too cunning. They suddenly attacked Qingxi Town, and no one expected it. Blame those heartless Black Bone Sect followers—they are the real culprits!"

Zhu Changlan nodded. He walked to the body of a commoner, gently closing his eyes, silently vowing in his heart: "Rest assured, I will eliminate all Black Bone Sect followers and avenge you! I will definitely find the fragments of the Tree of Life, reawaken the Tree of Life, purify the Underworld煞气 within Xuan Yuan, resolve the thousand-year bond between the three brothers, and restore peace and tranquility to the Three Realms!"

At that moment, the fragment of the Tree of Life in Zhu Changlan's bosom suddenly emitted a warm feeling. He was startled and quickly took out the fragment—only to see the fragment emitting a faint golden light, pointing to a mountain outside the town.

"This is the guidance of the Tree of Life fragment!" Zhu Changlan was ecstatic. He could feel that on that mountain, there was another fragment of the Tree of Life, waiting for him to find it.

With renewed determination, Zhu Changlan led his men toward the mountain, ready to continue his journey to find the fragments of the Tree of Life. The thousand-year bond between the three brothers was about to be resolved, and the balance of the Three Realms was within reach.
