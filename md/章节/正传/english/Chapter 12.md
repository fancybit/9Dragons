**Chapter 12: Poetry Conveys Affection, Xuan Jade Sheaths Unsheathed**

The smoke from the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area had not yet completely dissipated, and the air still carried a faint smell of blood and the acrid stench of lingering evil qi. Taoist Priest Xuan Chen, leaning on his fly whisk, stood beside the bluestone at the entrance to the forbidden area, his expression grave as he said to Zhu Changlan beside him: "The Demon Lord Xuan Yuan was an extremely fierce figure in the ancient demon realm, specializing in soul-devouring demon techniques. Back then, he slaughtered three major sects with his own strength, nearly overthrowing the order of the three realms. To protect all living beings, the ancestor of the Snow Spirit Cat clan exhausted all his cultivation with his Life Soul Pearl, sealing him beneath this Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, using the righteous qi of the spiritual veins to suppress his demonic power." He paused, waving his fly whisk toward the depths of the forbidden area, "And that Black Bone Sect leader is no ordinary demon—he is the first personal guard under Demon Lord Xuan Yuan, following the Demon Lord a hundred years ago and deeply trusted by him. After the Demon Lord was sealed, he narrowly escaped, secretly establishing the Black Bone Sect, feeding demons with blood essence and gathering fanatical followers. He has been biding his time for a hundred years, waiting for an opportunity to seize the power of the spiritual veins and help Demon Lord Xuan Yuan break free from his seal. This crisis was the first step of his long-planned scheme."

Zhu Changlan, leaning on the wooden sword that had accompanied him for a long time at his waist, stood on the open ground outside the forbidden area, looking at the busy figures before him, a heavy, indelible gloom furrowed between his brows. A few days ago, this was still the core of the spiritual veins, filled with lingering spiritual energy, but now it had become a post-war cleanup battlefield—elite soldiers in blood-stained armor carefully carrying scattered rubble and demon bones, each bone still stained with fresh black blood, shocking to the eye; Taoist priests from Qingyun Temple holding fly whisks, reciting purification mantras, trying to purify the lingering evil qi in the air, but the demonic power that had seeped deep into the soil was like a bone-attached疽, difficult to completely eradicate.

Although this spiritual vein crisis was barely contained by Zhu Changlan's Life Soul Pearl and the combined efforts of everyone, avoiding large-scale loss of life, it still came at a heavy cost. Six elite soldiers were surrounded and killed by the white-robed demon and Black Bone Sect cultists while covering the villagers' evacuation, stabbed multiple times and dying from exhaustion; over ten soldiers and Taoist priests were eroded by evil qi, their wounds festering and turning black, leaving incurable sequelae even if they survived by chance; and those villagers coerced by the Black Bone Sect had endured hellish torment—some watched their loved ones being torn apart by demons with their own eyes, some had their homes destroyed and became alone overnight, and days of terror and grief had already pushed their minds to the brink of collapse.

As the sky grew dark, the afterglow of the setting sun shone through the rock layers of the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, casting dappled orange-red light on the ground, but it couldn't dispel the surrounding desolation at all. Temporary tents were built against the mountain, densely arranged, each tent exuding a压抑 atmosphere. Zhu Changlan returned from his patrol of the camp, his steps extremely light, but he could still clearly hear the细碎 sounds coming from the tents: in the tent to the west, there were the suppressed sobs of a woman, intermittent, mixed with calls to her deceased husband; in the tent to the east, a young man's nightmare-like exclamation sounded, followed by rapid breathing—he must have been terrified by the appearance of the demons during the day; in the largest tent in the middle, it was even more deathly silent, with only occasional sighs, heavy as if they would crush the tent.

Zhu Changlan lifted the curtain and entered the middle tent, and was immediately greeted by a strong sense of exhaustion and despair. Dozens of survivors sat together, some leaning against the tent wall, their eyes empty, staring at the ground, with bloodshot eyes, clearly having stayed up all night; some held their heads in their hands, their fingers deeply embedded in their hair, their expressions of extreme pain; in the darkest corner, a young village woman tightly held her young child, the child curled up in her arms, his little face pale, his eyes tightly closed, but twitching from time to time, crying out "Daddy" in a vague voice.

That village woman was named Mrs. Lin, and her husband was a hunter at the foot of Qixia Mountain, agile and skilled—he was the backbone of the village. A few days ago, when the Black Bone Sect cultists突袭 the village, her husband held a firewood knife to fight the cultists to cover the villagers' evacuation, and was finally pierced through the chest by a demon's claws, dying in front of her. Since then, Mrs. Lin had not closed her eyes for a moment, and every night, the image of her husband falling kept replaying in her mind, scaring her into trembling all over, even her child being infected by her emotions, restless day and night.

"Mrs. Lin," Zhu Changlan walked forward gently, his voice extremely soft, afraid of disturbing the child in her arms, "The child is still young. If he keeps crying like this, his body will break down."

Mrs. Lin looked up, her eyes full of tears, the tear tracks winding down her haggard face, looking especially pitiful. She choked and said: "Ninth Prince, I... I can't control it... Every time I close my eyes, I see the image of my husband falling in front of me... I don't dare to sleep. I'm afraid that if I fall asleep, I won't be able to protect the child either..." As she spoke, she held the child even tighter, as if the child would be taken away in the next second.

When the others in the tent heard this, their eyes also turned red. An old man with white hair sighed, his voice hoarse: "Prince, it's not that we don't want to sleep, but we really can't. The roars of those demons, the laughter of the cultists, and the sight of our brothers falling—they're all ringing in our ears and flashing before our eyes all the time. Closing our eyes is a nightmare. It's better to stay awake and endure."

"Yes, Prince," a young soldier next to him continued, "As soon as I close my eyes at night, I feel the claws of those demons are about to scratch my face, scaring me into breaking out in cold sweat. How dare I sleep?"

Zhu Changlan fell silent. He was a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, and had joined Qingyun Temple in his early years. Taoist Priest Xuan Chen personally gave him the Taoist name "Xuan Yu Zhenren," meaning "a gentleman is like jade, clear and guarded at heart." He bore the Life Soul Pearl, capable of slaying demons and protecting spiritual veins, but in the face of the trauma in people's hearts, he seemed helpless. He could use demonic energy to purify evil qi, but he couldn't heal the grief in people's hearts; he could use a sword to slay demons, but he couldn't dispel the fear in people's hearts. Looking at these tormented people in front of him, he was filled with guilt—if he could be stronger, if he could have detected the Black Bone Sect's conspiracy earlier, perhaps no one would have sacrificed, and these people wouldn't have to endure such pain.

He subconsciously grasped the wooden sword at his waist, his fingers caressing the dense cracks on the sword body. This wooden sword was specially crafted for him by the old carpenter in the palace when he left the capital, made of century-old boxwood, hard in texture. It had accompanied him through the Southern Border War, the Qingfeng Ridge ambush, and the recent danger of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area. The cracks on the sword body were some cut by demon claws during battles with demons, some chopped out by Black Bone Sect cultists' weapons, especially when fighting the white-robed demon, this wooden sword withstood a blow from the white-robed demon infused with evil qi, and the cracks instantly spread. Now the sword body was already very fragile, and it would completely break if it went through another fierce battle.

"It would be nice if I had a handy divine weapon," Zhu Changlan sighed inwardly. As a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, his demonic energy was rich, and with the blessing of the Life Soul Pearl, ordinary weapons could not withstand his strength. It was not easy for this wooden sword to support him until now. But the road ahead was still long—the residual soul of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan had not been completely eliminated, and the remnants of the Black Bone Sect might make a comeback. That Demon Lord Xuan Yuan was a tyrant of the ancient demon realm, sealed by the Snow Spirit Cat ancestor with the Life Soul Pearl beneath the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, and the Black Bone Sect leader was his loyal follower, whose lifelong desire was to seize the power of the spiritual veins to help Demon Lord Xuan Yuan break his seal and dominate the three realms. Without a weapon that could blend with his power, how could he better protect these people, protect the Source of Spiritual Veins, and resist the joint attack of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan and the Black Bone Sect?

Just as he was at a loss, his gaze inadvertently swept over a wooden box in the corner of the tent. That was captured from the Black Bone Sect's stronghold, containing various miscellaneous items—books, musical instruments, and some fragmented ornaments. He suddenly remembered that when he was young, he had learned to play the pipa for a period of time from the court musician, although not proficient, he could play a few songs; he also remembered that he had studied poetry extensively since childhood, and those timeless poems had always had the power to soothe people's hearts.

Perhaps he could try to comfort these insomniacs with poetry and the sound of the pipa.

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, opened the wooden box, and sure enough, found a pipa inside. The pipa was deep brown all over, with exquisite lotus patterns carved on the body, and although the strings were a little loose, they were still intact. He took out the pipa, found a clean cloth, gently wiped the dust on the body, then sat down at the stone table in the center of the tent, adjusting the strings.

When everyone saw this, they all looked up curiously, their gazes falling on the pipa in Zhu Changlan's hand. They only knew that the Ninth Prince was highly skilled in martial arts, brave in slaying demons, but they had never heard that he could play the pipa. For a moment, the sobbing and sighing in the tent gradually stopped.

Zhu Changlan took a deep breath, and his fingertips gently plucked the strings. A soft and soothing melody slowly sounded, like a mountain spring flowing, like a spring breeze拂过 willow shoots, carrying a faint warmth, instantly dispelling the depression and desolation in the tent. His fingering was not very skillful, but extremely gentle, and every note seemed to carry healing power, gently landing on everyone's hearts, smoothing their tense nerves.

After playing "The Wild Geese Settle on the Sandbank," Zhu Changlan looked up, his gaze gentle as it swept over everyone, his tone soft and soothing, like spring rain, nourishing everyone's hearts: "Spring sleep is unaware of dawn, every place hears birds singing. Night comes with wind and rain, how many flowers fell?"

This was Meng Haoran's "Spring Dawn," four simple lines of poetry, under his gentle tone, full of vitality and warmth. Everyone closed their eyes, as if they were really in a spring morning, listening to the birds singing outside the window, feeling the gentle breeze. Those nightmares and fears seemed to be dispelled by these gentle lines.

Mrs. Lin held the child, gently patting his back, and silently recited the poem along with Zhu Changlan's tone. The child seemed to feel this gentle atmosphere, and his crying gradually stopped. His little head rested on Mrs. Lin's chest, his eyelids drooping slightly, showing a tired expression.

Seeing this, Zhu Changlan showed a hint of relief in his eyes, and plucked the strings again, playing "Fishing Boats Returning at Sunset." The melody was melodious, carrying a touch of leisure and tranquility, as if one could see the sunset scene of fishing boats returning to harbor. Along with the melody, he began to recite Tao Yuanming's "Return to Nature (I)": "From youth I've had no talent for the world's ways, / My nature has always loved the hills and fields. / By mistake I fell into the dusty net, / And lingered away for thirty years. / A caged bird longs for the old forest, / A pond fish thinks of the ancient deeps. / I plow the southern wilds where land is mine, / Keeping my simplicity, I return to farm and field. / A house of ten mu or so, / With straw-roofed cottages, eight or nine. / Elm and willow shade the back eaves, / Peach and plum trees line the front hall. / Dim in the distance are villages, / Smoke curling gently from the houses. / Dogs bark in the deep lanes, / Roosters crow on mulberry treetops. / No dust or clutter in the courtyard, / Empty rooms have plenty of leisure. / Long in the cage, now I'm free / To return once more to nature."

His tone was gentle yet firm, every word in the poem revealing a longing for quiet life and a pursuit of freedom. Those who had lost loved ones gradually let go of their grief, recalling the warm moments when their families sat together eating and chatting; the soldiers who couldn't sleep due to fear slowly relaxed their tense nerves, their minds no longer filled with the hideous faces of demons, but the smoke from their hometowns and the smiles of their loved ones.

The tent gradually grew quiet, leaving only Zhu Changlan's gentle pipa music and poetry, accompanied by occasional soft breathing. An old Taoist closed his eyes, tapping his fingers lightly on the ground, nodding slowly to the rhythm of the poem; the young soldier leaned against the tent wall, his brows gradually relaxing, the redness in his eyes fading; the child in Mrs. Lin's arms finally surrendered to sleep, a faint smile on his little face—presumably dreaming of being reunited with his father.

Zhu Changlan played and recited like this, song after song, poem after poem. He played "High Mountains and Flowing Water" and recited "Bright moon among the pines, clear spring flowing over stones"; he played "Autumn Moon in Han Palace" and recited "May we all be blessed with longevity, though far apart, we still share the beauty of the moon"; he played "Three Variations of Plum Blossoms" and recited "Fallen petals turn to mud and dust, only the fragrance remains." His pipa playing became more fluent, his tone more gentle, each note and each line of poetry like a beacon, illuminating the darkness in everyone's hearts, healing the wounds within.

As night deepened, even breathing sounds filled the tent. Most people leaned against the tent walls, falling into deep sleep with long-lost calm on their faces. Mrs. Lin, holding her sleeping child, also gradually closed her eyes, a look of peace on her lips. Seeing this, Zhu Changlan felt a warm current in his heart—he had finally found a way to comfort these people. It turned out that the power of gentleness could be so strong, even more powerful than his sword in dispelling the darkness in people's hearts.

He gently stopped playing the pipa, carefully stood up, afraid of disturbing the sleeping people. Stepping out of the tent, the night was thick, with countless stars dotting the dark sky, casting faint silver light. By the spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins, a golden halo glowed—that was the guardian power left by the Life Soul Pearl, slowly purifying the lingering evil qi.

Zhu Changlan walked to the spring, sat cross-legged, and began to cultivate using the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Technique." After days of battle, his demonic energy had mostly recovered, but the Life Soul Pearl, having protected its master multiple times, still needed nurturing. Golden pearl power gushed from deep within his dantian, swirling around him, intertwining with the spiritual energy emanating from the spring, forming a strange light screen that nourished his body.

During cultivation, he looked again at the wooden sword at his waist. In the moonlight, the cracks on the sword were particularly clear, like ferocious scars. He gently drew the sword, his fingers caressing the cracks, feeling reluctant—this wooden sword had accompanied him for so long, witnessing his growth and countless crises, but now it was time for it to retire.

"I must find someone who can forge a divine weapon as soon as possible," Zhu Changlan thought firmly. Ordinary blacksmiths could not forge weapons that could withstand his demonic energy and pearl power; only reclusive masters with extraordinary skills might have such ability. But these masters often had unpredictable whereabouts, and finding them would be no easy task.

Early the next morning, just as dawn broke, Taoist Priest Xuan Chen arrived at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area in a hurry with several Qingyun Temple Taoist priests. He had returned to the temple the previous night to consult ancient texts, supplementing secrets about Demon Lord Xuan Yuan, and came to inform Zhu Changlan of key information.

"Taoist Priest, you've finally arrived," Zhu Changlan stepped forward, bowing to greet him. After a night of cultivation, he looked much refreshed, but a hint of worry about finding a divine weapon still lingered between his brows, "You mentioned Demon Lord Xuan Yuan last night. Are there any other records in the ancient texts?"

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen nodded, his gaze falling on the spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins, his expression grave: "Last night, I consulted Qingyun Temple's secret scriptures and learned that when Demon Lord Xuan Yuan was sealed, he left a wisp of residual soul in the Black Bone Sect leader's body—first to protect him, and second to slowly accumulate demonic power through the leader's strength. The evil qi in this spring is exactly the ancient demonic power fused from Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul and the leader's demonic power. Ordinary purification techniques cannot completely eliminate it; we must use Qingyun Temple's treasure 'Pure Heart Dew,' combined with your Life Soul Pearl's power, to completely purify it."

"Then I'll trouble you, Taoist Priest," Zhu Changlan said with a bow. Taoist Priest Xuan Chen then took out a crystal-clear jade bottle from his bosom, containing a light green liquid—it was Pure Heart Dew. He poured the Pure Heart Dew into the spring, then sat cross-legged, forming hand seals and chanting incantations. The light green Pure Heart Dew intertwined with the golden pearl power around the spring, forming a strange light screen that slowly sank into the depths of the spring.

Zhu Changlan immediately activated the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Technique," channeling the power of the Life Soul Pearl, continuously injecting it into the spring. Golden pearl power and light green Pure Heart Dew worked together, continuously purifying the evil qi deep in the spring. Inside the spring, black qi collided fiercely with green and golden light, emitting a hissing sound, and the evil qi in the air gradually dissipated.

The intense battle lasted a full hour, and the black qi deep in the spring was finally completely purified. The spring returned to clarity, continuously gushing out pure heaven and earth spiritual energy. The surrounding plants, nourished by the spiritual energy, gradually regained vitality, with tender green shoots emerging from the soil and bright flowers blooming in the wind. The air was filled with rich spiritual energy, making people feel refreshed.

"Finally successful," Taoist Priest Xuan Chen sighed in relief, standing up with a satisfied smile. He looked at Zhu Changlan, noticing the cracked wooden sword at his waist, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes, "Prince, this wooden sword of yours is about to break, right?"

Zhu Changlan nodded, bitterly smiling: "Taoist Priest has a good eye. This wooden sword has accompanied me for a long time, going through countless battles, and now it's covered in scars, no longer able to withstand my strength. But finding a master who can forge a divine weapon is really not easy."

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen thought for a moment, then said: "If the Prince wants to find a master who can forge a divine weapon, you might as well go to Linjiang Town. Linjiang Town is located between the Source of Spiritual Veins and Qingyun Temple, a prosperous town. There is a blacksmith named 'Old Ironhead' in the town, with a mysterious background and extremely high weapon-forging skills. It is said that he can forge divine weapons from heaven and earth spiritual materials. Many martial artists and cultivators have come here to ask him to forge weapons. However, this Old Ironhead has a strange personality, rarely interacting with people on weekdays. Whether he can forge a weapon for the Prince depends on the Prince's luck." He paused, adding: "This Old Ironhead is actually a blacksmith of the Qi Family Army. Back then, the Qi Family Army dominated the southeast, slaying countless Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates, and the Miao Dao they used was forged by him."

A glimmer of hope flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes: "Oh? Is there such a master and spiritual material? Thank you, Taoist Priest, for telling me. I will go to Linjiang Town immediately to find Old Ironhead and the Xuan Jade Ore."

"Wait, Prince," Taoist Priest Xuan Chen quickly stopped him, "That Old Ironhead is withdrawn and values sincerity extremely. When you go, you must not put on the airs of a Prince, but treat him with sincerity, perhaps then you can move him. Additionally, Linjiang Town seems unsafe recently, with rumors that remnants of the Black Bone Sect are active in the town—those cultists are all followers of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan, and this time they are likely spying on the spiritual veins. You must be careful on this trip."

"I understand, thank you for your reminder, Taoist Priest," Zhu Changlan thanked him with a bow, then arranged the protection of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, and set off for Linjiang Town with several elite Imperial Guard dark guards.

Linjiang Town lived up to its reputation. As soon as they entered the town, they saw shops lining both sides of the street, merchants coming and going, with shouts and bargaining sounds filling the air, a prosperous scene. Stalls on both sides displayed various goods—fresh fruits and vegetables, exquisite ornaments, sharp weapons, and various specialty snacks, their aroma filling the air.

Zhu Changlan and his group walked slowly along the street, their eyes alertly observing their surroundings. As Taoist Priest Xuan Chen had said, the town did have an unusual atmosphere—the pedestrians mostly walked in a hurry, their eyes filled with vigilance, and occasionally a few men in black with strange movements passed by, surrounded by faint evil qi—they were clearly remnants of the Black Bone Sect. These cultists whispered to each other, frequently mentioning "leader," "Demon Lord," and "spiritual veins," obviously plotting something, presumably ordered by the Black Bone Sect leader to lurk here, waiting for an opportunity to cooperate in seizing the Source of Spiritual Veins.

"Prince, should we capture these Black Bone Sect remnants first?" a dark guard whispered.

Zhu Changlan shook his head, his voice deep: "No need. Our main purpose here is to find Old Ironhead and the Xuan Jade Ore, and we shouldn't alert the snake. Let's keep an eye on their movements first, and make plans after finding Old Ironhead."

The dark guards nodded, dispersing to secretly monitor the men in black. Zhu Changlan continued along the street, heading to Old Ironhead's blacksmith shop according to the address given by Taoist Priest Xuan Chen.

Old Ironhead's blacksmith shop was located in a remote corner of the east town, out of place with the town's prosperity. The shop front was very simple, just a low adobe house, with a pile of ironware and ores at the door, rusty and inconspicuous. Inside the shop, the sound of clanging iron could be heard, with sparks flying, accompanied by the blacksmith's heavy breathing, sounding exceptionally powerful.

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, gently pushing open the shop door. The shop was filled with a strong smell of iron filings and charcoal heat. An old man in coarse clothes, with a wrinkled face, was shirtless, waving a hammer, forging iron on an anvil. The old man was tall and strong, with muscular arms. Although old, he was still energetic, each blow full of strength, sparks flying, beating the iron block red-hot. On the shop wall hung a delicate Miao Dao, with the characters "Xin You" carved on the blade, and next to it hung a yellowed "Single Saber Technique Manual."

"Excuse me, are you Old Ironhead?" Zhu Changlan stepped forward, bowing respectfully.

Old Ironhead stopped his hammer, looking up and sizing up Zhu Changlan. His eyes were sharp as an eagle's, as if he could see into people's hearts. After a moment, he said coldly: "I am Old Ironhead. What do you want?"

Zhu Changlan said: "I am Zhu Changlan, Taoist name Xuan Yu Zhenren. I heard that you have extremely high weapon-forging skills, so I came to ask you to forge a suitable weapon for me. I bear demonic energy and spiritual energy, and ordinary weapons cannot withstand my strength. I am willing to find heaven and earth spiritual materials as raw materials, asking you to forge a divine weapon that can withstand powerful strength, slay demons, and purify evil qi, to guard the Source of Spiritual Veins and resist the conspiracy of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan and the Black Bone Sect."

Old Ironhead snorted, putting down his hammer, wiping sweat from his face, and said: "Forging a divine weapon? Easier said than done! Xuan Jade Ore is an ancient spiritual material, containing pure spiritual energy, able to resist demons and evil, and it's extremely rare to encounter. Moreover, forging a divine weapon requires a great deal of effort. Why should I forge one for you?"

Zhu Changlan said: "If you are willing to forge a weapon for me, I am willing to offer ten thousand taels of gold, and if you have any needs in the future, I will do my best to help you. I know the disaster of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan—the Black Bone Sect leader has harmed countless people to help him break the seal. I only hope to obtain a divine weapon to guard one side's peace and restore peace to the world."

"Ten thousand taels of gold?" Old Ironhead scoffed, his eyes full of disdain, "I'm not interested in gold. Since your Taoist name is Xuan Yu, you have some connection with the Xuan Jade Ore. But do you know why I'm waiting here?"

Zhu Changlan shook his head: "I don't know, please enlighten me, senior."

Old Ironhead pointed to the "Single Saber Technique Manual" on the wall: "This 'Single Saber Technique Manual' is the masterpiece of the Qi Family Army. Back then, I followed General Qi across the southeast, slaying countless Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates with the Xin You Saber Technique. Those pirates came from Japan, led by extreme Shinto forces, attempting to occupy the mainland's spiritual vein core and establish martial arts hegemony. Our Qi Family Army used the Xin You Saber Technique to break their Shikigami techniques, defeating them completely and making them dare not invade the Ming territory again."

Old Ironhead paused, continuing: "Forging a divine weapon requires sincerity. You must stay and help me forge iron for three days, while studying the essence of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique and the 'Single Saber Technique Manual.' After three days, I will forge a divine weapon for you."

Zhu Changlan was overjoyed, quickly saying: "I am willing! Thank you for your kindness!" He never expected Old Ironhead to really have the Xuan Jade Ore, nor that his Taoist name would become an opportunity—this must be destiny.

Subsequently, Zhu Changlan stayed at the blacksmith shop, helping Old Ironhead forge iron. Growing up in the palace, he had lived a life of luxury and had never done such heavy work. At first, he was uncoordinated, either swinging the hammer inaccurately or with insufficient strength. Before long, his hands were covered with dense blisters, and his arms ached so much he could barely lift them.

Old Ironhead watched but did not help, only saying coldly: "Forging iron requires not only strength but also patience and perseverance. If you can't endure this suffering, how can you own a divine weapon? To slay demons and protect others, you must first endure this tempering, just as Wang Yangming said: 'A gentleman is both like jade and iron'—jade for gentleness to protect the heart, iron for tenacity to guard the path. Only with both can you accomplish great things."

Zhu Changlan was shocked—Old Ironhead's words perfectly matched his state of mind. He bit his lip, refusing to give up. To obtain a suitable weapon, he must persist. He forged iron while channeling his demonic energy to relieve the soreness in his arms. Gradually, he found the knack, his hammer swings becoming more accurate and faster. His blisters burst and formed calluses, his arms growing stronger, and the sound of his hammering became more rhythmic, echoing with Old Ironhead's, forming a unique melody.

During these three days, Zhu Changlan spent every moment with Old Ironhead, gradually discovering that although Old Ironhead had a strange personality and cold exterior, he was kind at heart. Every day after forging iron, Old Ironhead would prepare hot water and medicine for him, and sometimes discuss weapon-forging insights with him, occasionally instructing him in saber techniques.

One evening, as Zhu Changlan wiped iron filings from his hands, he curiously asked: "Senior, you often mention the 'Single Saber Technique Manual' and the Xin You Saber Technique. I'm a bit curious—what's the difference between the two?" Old Ironhead was crouching on the ground tidying tools; hearing this, he looked up, a hint of surprise in his eyes, then a satisfied smile: "You can ask this question, which means you're truly learning. Alright, I'll tell you the difference between the two today."

He stood up, pointing to the "Single Saber Technique Manual" on the wall: "The 'Single Saber Technique Manual' is the basic saber technique work of the Qi Family Army, recording the basic moves, theories, and training methods of saber techniques, more like a saber technique textbook, suitable for daily training and basic learning. This book details basic moves such as 'Seeing the enemy draw the sword' and 'Guarding against the enemy on the left,' emphasizing the standardization and systematic nature of saber techniques, and is the foundation that every Qi Family Army soldier must learn."

"The Xin You Saber Technique, on the other hand, is a set of saber techniques created by General Qi based on the 'Single Saber Technique Manual' and his actual combat experience with Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates, specifically to counter the pirates." Old Ironhead's eyes showed a hint of nostalgia as he continued: "Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates were skilled in using Japanese swords and Shikigami techniques, with insidious and ruthless moves that ordinary saber techniques could not resist. General Qi modified the 'Single Saber Technique Manual' according to their characteristics, creating the Xin You Saber Technique. This set of saber techniques emphasizes practical application, focusing on speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness, using offense as defense, defeating the enemy with speed, able to kill the enemy in an instant before they can summon Shikigami."

"The application scenarios of the two are also different," Old Ironhead picked up an iron ingot, tossing it lightly, "The 'Single Saber Technique Manual' is suitable for daily training and basic learning, helping soldiers lay a solid foundation in saber techniques; while the Xin You Saber Technique is for the battlefield, especially effective against enemies like the Sakura Ghost Pavilion who are skilled in evil techniques. It's like the wooden sword in your hand and the future Xuan Jade Miao Dao— the wooden sword is suitable for daily practice, while the Xuan Jade Miao Dao is for slaying demons."

Zhu Changlan listened with great interest, nodding: "I see! So the 'Single Saber Technique Manual' is the foundation, and the Xin You Saber Technique is the advanced and practical application, the two complementing each other, indispensable." Old Ironhead smiled with satisfaction: "Exactly. Since you understand this, you will definitely be able to integrate the essence of these two in the future, unleashing greater power."

Zhu Changlan also learned much about heaven and earth spiritual materials and divine weapon forging from Old Ironhead—forging a divine weapon requires not only heaven and earth spiritual materials but also the infusion of the forger's heart and strength, and the fusion with the user's aura. Only then can the forged weapon truly unleash its maximum power and become the user's本命神兵 (life soul weapon).

Additionally, Zhu Changlan learned that Old Ironhead was once a famous swordsmith in the martial world, forging many divine weapons, but later, due to a change, he became incognito, opening this simple blacksmith shop in Linjiang Town, no longer easily forging weapons for others. The Xuan Jade Ore was something he obtained by chance in his early years, knowing its extraordinary spirituality, he had treasured it until now, waiting for a fated person.

Three days later, Zhu Changlan finally completed Old Ironhead's request. Although his iron-forging skills were not as精湛 as Old Ironhead's, he had mastered the basics, and the ironware he forged was very regular. Old Ironhead looked at Zhu Changlan, a hint of approval in his eyes: "Not bad, you're a young man who can endure hardship and has perseverance, worthy of the name 'Xuan Yu.' Speak, what kind of weapon do you want?"

Zhu Changlan said: "I want a Miao Dao. The Miao Dao has a unique shape, capable of chopping, cutting, thrusting, and picking, with infinite power, yet it is lightweight and agile, perfectly matching my combat style. I hope you can find spiritual materials that combine toughness and purification, forging a Miao Dao that combines gentleness and tenacity, inheriting jade's purification and iron's fierceness, in line with the meaning of 'a gentleman is both like jade and iron,' so that it can withstand my demonic energy and pearl power, slay demons, purify evil qi, and guard one side's peace."

Old Ironhead nodded: "The Miao Dao is indeed a good weapon, combining rigidity and flexibility, with extraordinary power. What you seek—'jade's gentleness, iron's tenacity'—requires ancient spiritual materials to forge." He paused, taking out a small box from his bosom, opening it to reveal a crystal-clear blue gem with a lifelike eye pattern carved on it, "More importantly, I have this Eye of Horus gem, given to me by that Tarot monk, capable of absorbing and releasing purification energy. I will use this Xuan Jade Ore as the main material, incorporate Deep Sea Cold Iron, and inlay this Eye of Horus gem at the hilt, forging this Miao Dao for you, living up to both the spiritual materials and the inheritance of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique."

He looked at the "Single Saber Technique Manual" on the wall, a hint of nostalgia in his eyes: "Back then, General Qi created the Xin You Saber Technique based on the 'Single Saber Technique Manual' and actual combat experience, a set of saber techniques specifically to counter Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates. This set of techniques emphasizes speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness, using offense as defense, defeating the enemy with speed, able to kill the enemy in an instant. I will infuse the essence of this set of techniques into the forging of this Miao Dao, making it not only extremely sharp but also perfectly compatible with the Xin You Saber Technique, helping you defeat enemies in battle."

Zhu Changlan was shocked, then overjoyed, quickly saying: "Thank you, senior! I never expected you to have such a spiritual material, and you're willing to use it for me. I will never forget your great kindness!"

Subsequently, Old Ironhead began forging the Miao Dao. He took out the Xuan Jade Ore from the backyard's secret room. The ore was light green all over, with a温润 texture, containing rich spiritual energy, glowing faintly in the sunlight, like a living thing. What was even more amazing was that when Zhu Changlan approached, the ore emitted a faint halo, faintly resonating with the Life Soul Pearl in his dantian, clearly recognizing him as the "fated person." Besides the Xuan Jade Ore, Old Ironhead also took out a black ore—Deep Sea Cold Iron, which was cold to the touch, extremely hard, capable of enhancing the weapon's sharpness and durability.

Old Ironhead placed the Xuan Jade Ore, Deep Sea Cold Iron, and the Eye of Horus gem into the furnace, using his internal strength to催动 the flames. The furnace fire grew increasingly intense, showing a rare purple color—flame that could only be produced at extremely high temperatures. The Xuan Jade Ore and Deep Sea Cold Iron gradually melted in the flames, becoming a liquid of interwoven green and black, while the Eye of Horus gem floated above the liquid, emitting a blue halo, intertwining with the spiritual energy in the liquid, forming a strange three-color light screen.

Old Ironhead waved his hammer, constantly striking the liquid on the anvil. His movements were skillful and precise, each blow full of strength, continuously removing impurities from the ore. At the same time, he carefully carved the Big Dipper pattern on the blade, the arrangement of the seven stars secretly matching the sword path of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique, each star representing a different saber technique move. Light blows were like the Xin You Saber Technique's agility; heavy blows were like its fierceness. Sparks flew, reflecting Old Ironhead's focused face, his forehead covered in sweat, but his eyes remained firm, never relaxing.

"Back then, our Qi Family Army faced 20,000 Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates with only 3,000 soldiers in the Taizhou Battle, using the Xin You Saber Technique to break their Shikigami techniques, slaying them so that blood flowed like a river, beheading over 5,000," Old Ironhead said while forging, "Those pirates' Shikigami techniques were extremely strange, able to summon various demons to assist in battle, and ordinary soldiers could not resist them. But our Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique emphasizes speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness, using offense as defense, defeating the enemy with speed, able to kill the enemy in an instant before they can summon Shikigami."

He paused, his hammer swinging faster: "In the Xinhe Battle, the Sakura Ghost Pavilion Japanese pirates used Shikigami techniques to summon a huge fox demon, which was extremely powerful, impervious to swords and spears, and even our cannons could not harm it. At the critical moment, General Qi used the 'Forward Strike' move of the Xin You Saber Technique, precisely piercing the fox demon's eye, killing it. This Miao Dao, I will also bestow it with such power, enabling it to exert the power of the Xin You Saber Technique, precisely slaying demons."

Zhu Changlan stood by, quietly watching Old Ironhead forge the Miao Dao, filled with admiration. He could clearly feel that Old Ironhead was continuously infusing his internal strength and heart into the Miao Dao during the forging process, making the Miao Dao gradually gain spirituality. Additionally, Old Ironhead occasionally looked at Zhu Changlan, a strange light in his eyes, guiding his aura to fuse with the Miao Dao. The liquid transformed from the Xuan Jade Ore always resonated with Zhu Changlan's Life Soul Pearl, as if naturally compatible with him. What was even more miraculous was that when the Big Dipper pattern on the blade solidified, it formed a mysterious resonance with the Life Soul Pearl in his dantian.

"Come here," Old Ironhead suddenly said.

Zhu Changlan stepped forward, asking: "Senior, what orders do you have?"

Old Ironhead said: "Extend your hand, channel your demonic energy and pearl power, infuse them into this Miao Dao. At the same time, imagine the structure of the Tree of Life, connecting your consciousness with the Big Dipper pattern on the blade. A divine weapon needs to fuse with the user's aura, and also resonate with mysterious power. You have a connection with the Xuan Jade Ore and the Eye of Horus, and now is the best opportunity. Don't waste this chance."

Zhu Changlan nodded, immediately extending his hand, activating the "Spiritual Pearl Nurturing Technique," channeling the power of the Life Soul Pearl. Golden demonic energy and pearl power flowed from his palm, slowly infusing into the interwoven green and black liquid. Instantly, the liquid erupted with a blinding light, the three colors of gold, green, and black intertwining, forming a strange light screen that enveloped the entire blacksmith shop. Within the light screen, the aura of jade's gentleness and iron's tenacity intertwined, exuding the awe-inspiring righteousness of a gentleman guarding the path.

Zhu Changlan could clearly feel his aura gradually fusing with the liquid, as if the Miao Dao being formed was part of his body. He could sense every change in the Miao Dao, feel its joy and anticipation, and more importantly, feel the power of "like jade gentleness, like iron tenacity" contained within, perfectly matching his Taoist name "Xuan Yu Zhenren" and his original intention of guarding the world.

The forging process lasted seven days. During these seven days, Old Ironhead worked day and night, dedicated to forging the Miao Dao, his figure gradually becoming haggard, but he never gave up; Zhu Changlan also stayed by his side, injecting demonic energy and pearl power every day, continuously fusing his aura with the Miao Dao, while also constantly reflecting on the meaning of "a gentleman is both like jade and iron," his state of mind and cultivation both improving significantly.

On the seventh day, just as the first ray of sunlight shone into the blacksmith shop, Old Ironhead finally completed the forging of the Miao Dao. He picked up the Miao Dao, handing it to Zhu Changlan, a hint of satisfaction in his eyes: "It's done. This Miao Dao has been forged. I named it 'Xuan Jade,' taking the spirit of the Xuan Jade Ore, your Taoist name 'Xuan Yu Zhenren,' and the essence of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique—'jade's gentleness to protect the heart, iron's tenacity to guard the path.' I hope it can fulfill your wish, slaying demons, purifying evil qi, guarding one side's peace, while also inheriting the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique, making the likes of the Sakura Ghost Pavilion dare not invade the Ming territory again."

Zhu Changlan took the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, his heart filled with excitement. This Miao Dao was light green all over, the blade smooth and delicate, with the Big Dipper pattern carefully carved on both sides. The arrangement of the seven stars secretly matched the sword path of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique, each star emitting a faint glow. The hilt was made of high-quality red sandalwood, wrapped with black silk rope, and most striking was the Eye of Horus gem inlaid at the end of the hilt, this blue gem emitting a soft light, resonating with the Big Dipper pattern on the blade, as if containing infinite mysterious power. In his hand, the Miao Dao felt very comfortable, as if it was born to belong to him, perfectly compatible with his aura.

He gently drew the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, the blade glowing with a faint green light, extremely sharp, faintly emitting a dragon's roar-like hum, containing jade's clarity, iron's depth, and the fierceness of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique. In the sunlight, the Big Dipper pattern on the blade emitted bright light, intertwined with the blue halo of the Eye of Horus gem, forming a magical light screen. He channeled his demonic energy and pearl power, infusing them into the Xuan Jade Miao Dao. Instantly, the Miao Dao erupted with a blinding three-color light (gold, green, blue), intertwining with the golden demonic energy around him, forming a strange light screen. The Miao Dao not only did not break under the power but perfectly fused with his aura, as if it was part of his body, able to accurately sense his thoughts, unleashing the power of "like jade gentleness, like iron tenacity" and the essence of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique to the extreme. What was even more amazing was that when he focused his attention, he could feel the Eye of Horus energy in the blade resonating with the Life Soul Pearl in his dantian, while the Big Dipper pattern on the blade呼应 with the "Single Saber Technique Manual" in his mind, deepening his understanding of the Xin You Saber Technique.

"What a good blade! Truly a divine weapon!" Zhu Changlan was overjoyed, couldn't help but swing the Miao Dao a few times. In his hand, the Miao Dao was light and sharp, each swing carrying the dual power of jade's purification and iron's fierceness, stirring the surrounding air violently, forming invisible air waves that made the ironware and ore in the blacksmith shop tremble slightly. He could clearly feel that the power of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao far exceeded his previous wooden sword. With this Miao Dao, his ability to fight against demons had increased significantly, and in the future, even when facing the joint forces of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan and the Black Bone Sect leader, he would have more confidence.

Old Ironhead looked at Zhu Changlan, a hint of satisfaction in his eyes: "The Xuan Jade Miao Dao has fused with your aura, inheriting the spirit of the Xuan Jade Ore, the purification power of the Eye of Horus, and the essence of the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique, already becoming your life soul weapon. It can not only withstand your demonic energy and pearl power but also automatically absorb heaven and earth spiritual energy, continuously enhancing its own power, while also purifying evil qi, protecting you. The Eye of Horus gem at the hilt can absorb and release purification energy, and the Big Dipper pattern on the blade is secretly compatible with the Qi Family Army's Xin You Saber Technique sword path, enhancing your saber technique perception, allowing you to better unleash the power of the Xin You Saber Technique in battle."

He paused, his gaze becoming profound: "Ten years ago, a Tarot monk from Horus came to the Qi Family Army, telling my fortune, saying that after the Wanli era, the Qi Family Army would be purged, and if I wanted to avoid disaster, I must retire early. He also said that I was destined to wait here for a Ninth Prince who was the reincarnation of the Xuan Yu Emperor, to forge a divine weapon for him, helping him guard the Source of Spiritual Veins and resist the conspiracy of the Black Bone Sect and Demon Lord Xuan Yuan. I never expected that today you would really come."

Zhu Changlan was filled with gratitude, bowing deeply to Old Ironhead: "Thank you for forging such a divine weapon for me! Your great kindness, I will never forget! I will definitely uphold the original intention of 'a gentleman is both like jade and iron,' slaying demons with the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, guarding the spiritual veins, and living up to your trust!"

Old Ironhead waved his hand: "No need to thank me. Forging this Xuan Jade Miao Dao is also fate. You bear the mission of guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins, and your Taoist name 'Xuan Yu' matches the spiritual materials—this Miao Dao was meant for you. However, you must remember that although the divine weapon is powerful, it also requires the user to have a righteous heart. If you ever harbor evil thoughts in the future,背离 (deviating from) the original intention of 'a gentleman is both like jade and iron,' the Xuan Jade Miao Dao will automatically seal itself, no longer serving you."

He paused, adding: "When I was young, I forged a divine weapon named 'Soul Devourer,' intending to give it to a martial arts hero to slay demons and protect the people. However, that hero became greedy,背离 (deviating from) his original intention, using the power of the Soul Devourer Sword to do evil, harming many innocent people. Helplessly, I had to personally kill him and seal the Soul Devourer Sword. After that incident, I made a vow never to easily forge divine weapons for others unless I met someone with a righteous heart, caring for the world, and able to uphold their original intention. You are a descendant of the Snow Spirit Cat clan, bearing the responsibility of guardianship, with the Taoist name 'Xuan Yu,' able to endure hardship, have perseverance, and uphold the belief of 'a gentleman is both like jade and iron'—I trust you with this Xuan Jade Miao Dao."

Zhu Changlan nodded solemnly: "I will remember your teachings! In this life, I will definitely uphold my original intention, comforting the people with jade's gentleness, slaying demons with iron's tenacity, purifying evil qi, guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins, guarding the people of the world, and never harboring evil thoughts, living up to your expectations and the spirituality of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao!"

Old Ironhead nodded: "Good, I believe you. Now go— the crisis of the Source of Spiritual Veins has not been completely resolved, Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul is still secretly dormant, and the Black Bone Sect leader is eyeing the spiritual veins. Those cultists are just his pawns, used to distract various forces. You need to quickly enhance your strength, familiarize yourself with the power of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, and prepare for the Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's breakthrough and the Black Bone Sect's attack. By the way, the Xuan Jade Ore is no ordinary item—it is compatible with your Life Soul Pearl. In the future, if the Xuan Jade Miao Dao encounters a bottleneck, you can find a place with abundant spiritual veins, nurture it with the power of the pearl, and it may unlock more powerful purification power, restraining Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's soul-devouring demon techniques."

Zhu Changlan bowed deeply to Old Ironhead again: "I take my leave! Please take care, senior! I will definitely come back to visit you in the future!"

With that, Zhu Changlan, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, left the blacksmith shop with the Imperial Guard dark guards. Just走出 the blacksmith shop, they saw the Black Bone Sect remnants they had monitored earlier gathering at a nearby alley, seemingly plotting something. They were surrounded by strong evil qi, their eyes fierce, holding weapons, clearly waiting for the Black Bone Sect leader's order, ready to create chaos in Linjiang Town, distracting Zhu Changlan and others, creating an opportunity for the leader to seize the Source of Spiritual Veins.

"It seems these Black Bone Sect remnants intend to cause chaos in Linjiang Town, paving the way for their leader to seize the Source of Spiritual Veins," Zhu Changlan's eyes flashed with a cold light, gripping the Xuan Jade Miao Dao at his waist, his demonic energy and pearl power surging, golden demonic energy and green spiritual energy intertwining, forming a blinding light screen, exuding the awe-inspiring righteousness of "like jade gentleness, like iron tenacity." "Today, let you experience the power of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao!"

As the words fell, Zhu Changlan leaped out, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, charging toward the Black Bone Sect remnants. His figure was agile, like a hunting Snow Spirit Cat, each movement precise and swift, fully deserving the nickname "Cat Nine." With the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in hand, he was like a tiger adding wings, each strike carrying the dual power of jade's purification and iron's fierceness, slashing at the Black Bone Sect remnants.

A Black Bone Sect remnant saw this, holding a long knife, slashing fiercely at Zhu Changlan's chest. Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, using the "Left Guard" move from the "Xin You Saber Technique," the Miao Dao in his hand deflecting sideways, blocking the opponent's long knife, then顺势 turning, changing to the "Forward Strike" move, a green sword qi shooting out, accurately hitting the remnant's chest. The remnant let out a shrill scream, his body instantly pierced by the sword qi, the evil qi in his body also purified by the jade's spiritual energy in the sword qi, turning into a wisp of black smoke, completely dissipating into the air.

Other Black Bone Sect remnants saw this, a trace of fear rising in their hearts, but still fearlessly charging at Zhu Changlan. They waved their weapons, their bodies surging with evil qi, forming black barriers, charging at Zhu Changlan. These cultists were all fanatical followers of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan, willing to sacrifice themselves for him, their moves reckless and ruthless.

Zhu Changlan showed no fear, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, constantly shuttling through the remnants' attacks. He used the "See the Enemy Draw the Sword" move from the "Single Saber Technique Manual," spinning his body to avoid the围攻 of several remnants, then changing to the "Swing Sword at the Enemy" move, the Miao Dao slashing horizontally, cutting a remnant in half.紧接着 (Immediately after), he used the "Advance and Kill the Enemy" move, charging forward, the Miao Dao thrusting straight, piercing through another remnant's heart. With each swing of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, it carried the dual power of jade's purification and iron's fierceness, slaying the remnants while purifying the evil qi. Green spiritual energy and golden demonic energy continuously flowed from the Miao Dao, completely dispelling the surrounding evil qi, making the air fresh again. He used iron's tenacity to resist attacks, jade's gentleness to protect the Imperial Guard dark guards, every move embodying the meaning of "a gentleman is both like jade and iron."

The Imperial Guard dark guards also took action, fighting with the Black Bone Sect remnants. They were all skilled, cooperating with Zhu Changlan, constantly slaying remnants. Although they were more or less injured, they never retreated, their eyes firm, fighting bravely.

After a fierce battle, the remnants were finally completely eliminated, leaving only one leader, trembling on his knees, begging Zhu Changlan for mercy.

"Speak! Where is your leader now? What's the current situation of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul? What conspiracy are you gathering here for?" Zhu Changlan held the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, pressing it against the leader's neck, his tone cold.

The leader was so frightened that he trembled all over, quickly saying: "Spare me, Prince! Our... our leader has already gone to the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area with elite demons! He wants to seize the power of the Source of Spiritual Veins to help Demon Lord Xuan Yuan break the seal and awaken! Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul has recently detected fluctuations in the spiritual vein's spiritual energy, and his power is recovering. As long as the leader can seize the spiritual vein's power, he can completely break the seal, allowing the Demon Lord to re-enter the world! We... we were just ordered to gather here, preparing to attack the people of Linjiang Town, attracting the Taoist Priest and the Prince's attention, buying time for the leader..."

A cold light flashed in Zhu Changlan's eyes: "Who exactly is the Black Bone Sect leader? What is his relationship with Demon Lord Xuan Yuan?"

"I... I don't know the leader's true identity, I only know he wears white clothes, he is Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's most loyal follower, following the Demon Lord a hundred years ago. After the Demon Lord was sealed, he established the Black Bone Sect, gathering demons and followers everywhere, just waiting for an opportunity to help the Demon Lord break the seal! The leader is extremely powerful, with many powerful demons following him, and even we cultists have never seen his true face..." The leader trembled as he spoke.

Zhu Changlan was shocked—the white-robed demon! It seemed the Black Bone Sect leader was the white-robed demon he had fought in the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area! He never expected this person to be an old subordinate of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan, who had been biding his time for a hundred years, just to help Demon Lord Xuan Yuan break the seal—his ambition and obsession were truly terrifying.

"Useless," Zhu Changlan snorted coldly, swinging the Miao Dao in his hand, ending the leader's life. Then he said to the Imperial Guard dark guards: "Quick, return to the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area immediately! The white-robed demon is going to seize the power of the Source of Spiritual Veins to help Demon Lord Xuan Yuan break the seal—we must rush back to stop him!"

"Yes!" The Imperial Guard dark guards responded in unison, then followed Zhu Changlan, rushing toward the direction of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area.

On the way, Zhu Changlan couldn't help but swing the Xuan Jade Miao Dao again. The Miao Dao's power was truly extraordinary, each strike carrying the dual power of jade's purification and iron's fierceness. The trees around were cut down with a single slash, stones were sent flying with a single pick, and even the airflow in the air was stirred into violent waves. He could clearly feel that with this Xuan Jade Miao Dao, his ability to fight against demons had increased significantly. If he encountered the white-robed demon now, he would be able to compete with him, no longer as helpless as before.

Such a suitable weapon, complementing his agile movements as "Cat Nine" and his state of mind as "Xuan Yu Zhenren," if he encountered the white-robed demon now, he would definitely be able to fight him on equal terms, no longer as embarrassed as before.

Just as Zhu Changlan was rushing, the Life Soul Pearl deep in his dantian suddenly trembled slightly, emitting a faint golden light. Zhu Changlan's heart tightened, immediately focusing his mind to sense it. He could clearly feel that the pearl was transmitting a dangerous signal to him—the signal came from the direction of the Source of Spiritual Veins, indicating that the Source of Spiritual Veins was in great danger.

"Hurry! Speed up!" Zhu Changlan shouted, his heart filled with anxiety. The white-robed demon was already at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, and the Source of Spiritual Veins was in great danger—he must rush back as soon as possible to stop the white-robed demon's conspiracy, otherwise, once Demon Lord Xuan Yuan broke the seal, the world would fall into chaos, and countless lives would be lost.

The group sped up, rushing toward the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area at full speed. The Xuan Jade Miao Dao at Zhu Changlan's waist emitted a faint green light, as if sensing the crisis of the Source of Spiritual Veins, resonating with the Life Soul Pearl in his dantian, continuously transmitting power to him, helping him maintain his peak state.

Soon, they arrived at the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area. Sure enough, as Zhu Changlan had expected, the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area was already in chaos. The white-robed demon led dozens of powerful demons,突袭 (raiding) the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area. Taoist Priest Xuan Chen and the remaining soldiers and Taoist priests were fighting hard to resist, but they were still outmatched, suffering heavy casualties.

The white-robed demon stood in front of the Source of Spiritual Veins' spring, his hands condensing thick evil qi, injecting it fiercely into the spring. The spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins was continuously bubbling, the spiritual energy flowing away with the injection of evil qi, the color of the spring gradually turning black. Around him, several powerful demons were fighting with the soldiers and Taoist priests, their movements ruthless, each strike carrying terrifying power, making it difficult for the soldiers and Taoist priests to resist.

"White-robed demon! Stop!" Zhu Changlan shouted angrily, leaping out, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, slashing at the white-robed demon.

The white-robed demon turned his head, seeing Zhu Changlan, a hint of surprise in his eyes, followed by a sneer: "It's you, Ninth Prince! I didn't expect you to come back so soon! But it's just in time—with your Life Soul Pearl, I can better help the Demon Lord break the seal!"

Saying that, the white-robed demon didn't dodge, condensing a black sword with evil qi, blocking Zhu Changlan's Xuan Jade Miao Dao. "Clang!" A loud noise sounded, golden light and black qi colliding, forming a powerful shockwave that spread in all directions. The surrounding rocks were shattered by the shockwave, and the trees were uprooted, flying everywhere.

Zhu Changlan was sent back several steps by the shockwave, his blood boiling, but he quickly stabilized his figure, looking at the white-robed demon with a cold light in his eyes. He could clearly feel that the white-robed demon's power was very strong, even stronger than before, but with the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in hand, he was no longer afraid. "White-robed demon, today I will use this Xuan Jade Miao Dao to eliminate you, ending your conspiracy to harm the world!"

The white-robed demon sneered: "Xuan Jade Miao Dao? It seems you found a good weapon! But so what? Today, the Demon Lord will break the seal, and the entire world will belong to us! You can't stop it!"

Saying that, the white-robed demon charged at Zhu Changlan again, the black sword in his hand slashing fiercely, carrying a strong corrosive evil qi, slashing at Zhu Changlan's neck.

Zhu Changlan's eyes narrowed, his figure agilely dodging, using the "Right Guard" move from the "Xin You Saber Technique," the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand blocking sideways, then immediately changing to the "Backward Strike" move, the Miao Dao slashing backward, a green sword qi shooting out, hitting the white-robed demon's back.

The white-robed demon let out a muffled groan, his body trembling slightly, the black qi around him also flickering, clearly injured by Zhu Changlan's attack. He turned around, looking at Zhu Changlan with a shocked expression: "How is this possible? Your power has increased so much in just a few days!"

"That's the power of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao and the Xin You Saber Technique!" Zhu Changlan said coldly, charging at the white-robed demon again, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand emitting a blinding three-color light, slashing at the white-robed demon's chest.

The white-robed demon's eyes flashed with a cold light, his hands condensing a thick black qi, forming a black shield, blocking in front of him. "Clang!" The Xuan Jade Miao Dao struck the black shield, emitting a loud noise, the black shield instantly cracking, then shattering completely. The white-robed demon was sent flying by the impact, falling heavily to the ground, vomiting a mouthful of black blood.

"Impossible! This can't be!" The white-robed demon's eyes were full of disbelief, looking at the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in Zhu Changlan's hand, a hint of fear in his eyes. He never expected that Zhu Changlan would obtain such a powerful divine weapon, able to break his black shield so easily.

"Nothing is impossible!" Zhu Changlan said coldly, charging at the white-robed demon again, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand emitting a blinding light, ready to deliver the final blow.

Just then, a powerful evil qi suddenly erupted from the Source of Spiritual Veins' spring, a black figure slowly emerging from the spring. The figure was tall and majestic, with a pair of blood-red eyes, emitting a terrifying aura, clearly the residual soul of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan.

"Not good! Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul is about to break the seal!" Taoist Priest Xuan Chen's voice came from the side, filled with anxiety.

Zhu Changlan's heart tightened, looking at the black figure emerging from the spring, then at the white-robed demon on the ground. He knew that if he didn't stop Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul now, once it broke the seal, the consequences would be unimaginable. But if he went to stop Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul, the white-robed demon would escape, and he would cause endless trouble in the future.

At this critical moment, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand suddenly emitted a bright light, resonating with the Life Soul Pearl in his dantian, as if telling him to prioritize stopping Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul.

Zhu Changlan gritted his teeth, making a decision. He turned around, charging toward the Source of Spiritual Veins' spring, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, slashing at the black figure emerging from the spring. "Demon Lord Xuan Yuan! Today I will eliminate you, ending your threat to the world!"

The black figure looked at Zhu Changlan, his blood-red eyes filled with disdain: "A mere Snow Spirit Cat descendant, dare to challenge me? Today, I will let you know the gap between us!"

Saying that, the black figure waved his hand, a thick black qi condensing into a huge black claw, grabbing at Zhu Changlan.

Zhu Changlan showed no fear, his eyes firm, holding the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, injecting all his demonic energy and pearl power into it. The Xuan Jade Miao Dao erupted with a blinding three-color light, the Eye of Horus gem on the hilt also emitting a bright blue light, forming a powerful purification barrier, blocking the black claw.

"Break!" Zhu Changlan shouted, slashing the Xuan Jade Miao Dao downward, the three-color light blade slashing at the black claw. "Clang!" A loud noise sounded, the black claw was instantly shattered, the three-color light blade continued downward, slashing at the black figure.

The black figure's eyes widened in shock, apparently not expecting Zhu Changlan to have such powerful strength. He quickly condensed a black shield, blocking in front of him. "Clang!" The three-color light blade struck the black shield, the black shield instantly shattering, the light blade continuing downward, slashing at the black figure's chest.

The black figure let out a shrill scream, his body trembling violently, the black qi around him flickering, clearly severely injured by Zhu Changlan's attack. "Impossible! How can a mere Snow Spirit Cat descendant have such powerful strength!"

"Because I am the guardian of the Source of Spiritual Veins!" Zhu Changlan shouted, injecting all his remaining strength into the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, slashing at the black figure again. "Today, I will completely eliminate you, ending your threat to the world!"

The black figure's eyes were full of fear, trying to escape, but it was too late. The three-color light blade of the Xuan Jade Miao Dao had already arrived, slashing through his body. The black figure let out a final shrill scream, his body gradually dissipating, turning into a wisp of black smoke, completely dissipating into the air.

At the same time, the white-robed demon, seeing Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul being eliminated, his eyes filled with despair. He knew that his hundred-year conspiracy had completely failed, and if he didn't escape now, he would be killed by Zhu Changlan. Without hesitation, he turned around, trying to escape.

"Want to leave? It's too late!" Zhu Changlan shouted, throwing the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand. The Xuan Jade Miao Dao turned into a green light, accurately hitting the white-robed demon's back. The white-robed demon let out a shrill scream, his body being pierced by the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, the evil qi in his body being continuously purified by the jade's spiritual energy in the Miao Dao, turning into a wisp of black smoke, completely dissipating into the air.

With the elimination of Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul and the white-robed demon, the crisis of the Source of Spiritual Veins was finally resolved. The spring of the Source of Spiritual Veins gradually recovered its clarity, the black color fading, and pure spiritual energy gushing out again. The surrounding trees and flowers gradually regained their vitality, and the air became fresh again, no longer filled with the stench of evil qi.

Taoist Priest Xuan Chen and the remaining soldiers and Taoist priests gathered around, looking at Zhu Changlan with admiration. "Ninth Prince, you've saved the Source of Spiritual Veins, saved the world!"

Zhu Changlan smiled faintly, recalling the scenes of these days—from using poetry and music to comfort the survivors, to finding Old Ironhead and obtaining the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, and finally eliminating Demon Lord Xuan Yuan's residual soul and the white-robed demon—each step was full of challenges, but also full of gains. He looked at the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in his hand, a hint of firmness in his eyes. From now on, he would use this Xuan Jade Miao Dao, uphold the original intention of "a gentleman is both like jade and iron," guard the Source of Spiritual Veins, protect the world's peace, and never let such a crisis happen again.

"The crisis has been resolved, but we must not let our guard down," Zhu Changlan said, looking at everyone, "The Black Bone Sect may still have remnants, and there may be other forces coveting the Source of Spiritual Veins. We must strengthen the protection of the Source of Spiritual Veins, and at the same time, continuously enhance our strength, so that we can deal with any crisis."

Everyone nodded, agreeing with Zhu Changlan's words. They knew that although the crisis had been resolved this time, the world was still not peaceful, and they needed to be vigilant at all times to protect the Source of Spiritual Veins and the world's peace.

Subsequently, they cleaned up the battlefield, treating the wounded, and strengthening the protection of the Source of Spiritual Veins. Zhu Changlan also sent people to inform Zhu Changluo in the capital of the situation, so that he could be prepared for any possible changes.

A few days later, everything returned to calm. The Source of Spiritual Veins was once again full of spiritual energy, the surrounding vegetation thriving, and the air fresh. Zhu Changlan stood on the viewing platform of the Spiritual Vein Forbidden Area, looking at the distant mountains and rivers, the Xuan Jade Miao Dao at his waist emitting a faint green light, resonating with the Life Soul Pearl in his dantian.

He knew that his journey of guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins had just begun. In the future, there would be more challenges waiting for him, but with the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in hand, the support of Taoist Priest Xuan Chen and others, and the care of Zhu Changluo, he had the confidence to face any challenge, uphold the original intention of "a gentleman is both like jade and iron," guard the Source of Spiritual Veins, and protect the world's peace.

The story of Zhu Changlan, the Ninth Prince with the Taoist name "Xuan Yu Zhenren," his Life Soul Pearl, and the Xuan Jade Miao Dao, began to spread among the people, becoming a legend. People praised his kindness, courage, and sense of responsibility, regarding him as the protector of the world, the guardian of the Source of Spiritual Veins.

And Zhu Changlan, with the Xuan Jade Miao Dao in hand, continued his journey of guarding the Source of Spiritual Veins, protecting the world's peace, and writing his own legend."}}}
